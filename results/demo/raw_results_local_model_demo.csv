### **ルート詳細：**
1. **Niigata → Nagaoka**
   - 旅行時間：70分
   - 到着時刻：8:00 + 70分 = **15:10**（※実際は9:00以降に到着するため、時間的に問題なし）
   - Store U（Nagaoka）の受取時間：9:00-12:00 → **到着時刻が15:10で、受取時間外** → **不可**

- Niigata → Nagaoka は **70分** → 8:00 + 70分 = **15:10** → **受取時間外**

   - Store V（Joetsu）の受取時間：10:00-11:00 → **到着時刻が16:00 → 受取時間外** → **不可**

### **再検討：Store Vの受取時間は10:00-11:00、Store Uは9:00-12:00**

→ **Store Vの受取時間内に到着するには、Niigata → Joetsu が10:00前後で到着する必要あり**
→ 旅行時間120分 → 8:00 + 120分 = 16:00 → **不可**

→ **Store Uの受取時間内に到着するには、Niigata → Nagaoka が9:00前後で到着する必要あり**
→ 旅行時間70分 → 8:00 + 70分 = 15:10 → **不可**

---

### **結論：**
**どちらの目的地も、出発時刻8:00から計算すると、受取時間内に到着できない。**

→ **最適ルートは存在しない**（ただし、実務では「受取時間内に到着する」ことが前提なので、このスケジュールは**不可能**）

### **ただし、実務的対応として：**
- Store U（Nagaoka）は **15:10に到着** → 受取時間外 → **翌日配達** または **受取時間の延長** が必要

---

### **最適ルート（実務的に可能な最小コスト）：**
**Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu**（ただし、Store Uは15:10に到着 → 受取時間外）

→ **コスト計算：**
- 旅行時間：70 + 60 = 130分
- 燃料コスト：130分 × 12円/分 = **1,560円**

→ **ただし、Store Uの受取が不可能**

- **運行時間**：35分（Shizuoka→Fujiは35分、Fuji→Hamamatsuは未定だが、Shizuoka→Hamamatsuは80分、Numazu→Fujiは20分、Fuji→Hamamatsuは？）
- **注意**：問題文に「Fuji → Hamamatsu」の運行時間は**未記載**。しかし、Shizuoka→Hamamatsuは80分、Shizuoka→Numazuは50分、Numazu→Fujiは20分、Hamamatsu→Numazuは100分とある。
- **Fuji→Hamamatsuの運行時間は、Shizuoka→Hamamatsuの80分から、Shizuoka→Fujiの35分を引くと45分**（仮定）→ しかし、**実際の距離や時間は不明**。
- **代替案**：Hamamatsu→Numazuは100分（逆方向）→ これは**Fuji→Hamamatsuの時間は不明**だが、**Shizuoka→Hamamatsuが80分**なので、**Fuji→Hamamatsuは80 - 35 = 45分**と仮定。

→ **運行時間**：45分
→ **燃料コスト**：45 × 10 = **450円**
→ **到着時刻**：11:10 + 45分 = **11:55**
→ **Hamamatsuの受取時間帯**：11:00-14:00 → **OK**

[Reasoning]
- Store L (Hatsukaichi) has receiving hours until 10:30, and arrival at 10:00 is within window → prioritized first
- Store J (Kure) requires arrival by 11:30, and can be reached from Hatsukaichi (arrive 10:45) → next

Niigata (8:00) -> Nagaoka (Arrive 9:10, Depart 10:45) -> Joetsu (Arrive 11:45, Complete 12:25)

[Reasoning]
- Store U (Nagaoka) has receiving hours 9:00-12:00, and arrival at 9:10 is within window; unloading takes 35 min, so departure is 10:45.
- Store V (Joetsu) has receiving hours 10:00-11:00, and arrival at 11:45 is outside window → **not feasible**.
- Since Joetsu cannot be reached within its receiving window from Niigata (120 min travel, arrival at 14:00), and Nagaoka → Joetsu takes 60 min (arrival at 9:10 + 60 min = 10:10), which is still outside Joetsu’s 10:00-11:00 window, Joetsu **cannot be served** under current constraints.
- Therefore, only Store U can be served, and Joetsu is skipped due to time window infeasibility.

[Total Cost]
Travel: 70 min → 70 × 12 = 840 yen  
Unloading: 35 min  
Total Duration: 70 + 35 = 105 min  
Total Cost: 840 yen (fuel only; no unloading cost specified in example, but if included, it would be 35 × 12 = 420 yen → total 1260 yen)

**Note**: Since Joetsu’s receiving window is not feasible, it is excluded from the route. If the system requires serving all stores, this plan is optimal under given constraints.

- Store U (Nagaoka) has receiving hours 9:00-12:00, and arrival at 8:50 allows unloading within the window (must depart by 9:25 to respect duration)
- Store V (Joetsu) has receiving hours 10:00-11:00, and arrival at 10:20 fits within the window
- Direct route from Niigata to Joetsu takes 120 min, which would arrive at Joetsu at 10:00 — but this is not feasible since it would require leaving Niigata at 8:00 + 120 min = 20:00, which is after Joetsu’s receiving hours end at 11:00
- Route via Nagaoka is feasible: Niigata → Nagaoka (70 min, arrive 8:50), then Nagaoka → Joetsu (60 min, arrive 10:20) — within Joetsu’s receiving hours

**Assumptions:**

*   The goal is to minimize total travel *time* while respecting receiving hours.  Cost will be calculated based on the time taken.
*   We'll assume packages are delivered as soon as possible at each location within the receiving window.
*   We'll assume no delays during delivery (package handling time is negligible).

**Possible Routes & Calculations:**

Let's explore the possible routes and their associated costs.  I will calculate total travel time and then total fuel cost.

    *   Hiroshima -> Kure: 45 min. Arrival at Kure: 9:30 + 45min = 10:15.  Within receiving hours (10:00-11:30).
    *   Kure -> Higashihiroshima: 60 min. Arrival at Higashihiroshima: 10:15 + 60min = 11:15.  Within receiving hours (All Day).
    *   Higashihiroshima -> Hatsukaichi:  We need to find the travel time. It's not directly given, but we can calculate it using other routes: Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi is 30 min and Hiroshima -> Higashihiroshima is 40min.  This doesn't help directly. We need to assume a reasonable travel time. Let's estimate it as 50 min (a bit more than Hiroshima to Hatsukaichi, accounting for going from Higashihiroshima). Arrival at Hatsukaichi: 11:15 + 50min = 12:05.  Outside receiving hours (9:00-10:30). **This route is invalid.**

*   **Route 2: Hiroshima -> Higashihiroshima (K) -> Kure (J) -> Hatsukaichi (L)**

    *   Hiroshima -> Higashihiroshima: 40 min. Arrival at Higashihiroshima: 9:30 + 40min = 10:10. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    *   Higashihiroshima -> Kure: 60 min. Arrival at Kure: 10:10 + 60min = 11:10. Within receiving hours (10:00-11:30).
    *   Kure -> Hatsukaichi: We need to find the travel time. It's not directly given, but we can calculate it using other routes: Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi is 30 min and Hiroshima -> Kure is 45min.  This doesn't help directly. Let's estimate it as 60 min (a bit more than Hiroshima to Kure, accounting for going from Kure). Arrival at Hatsukaichi: 11:10 + 60min = 12:10. Outside receiving hours (9:00-10:30). **This route is invalid.**

*   **Route 3: Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi (L) -> Kure (J) -> Higashihiroshima (K)**

    *   Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi: 30 min. Arrival at Hatsukaichi: 9:30 + 30min = 10:00. Within receiving hours (9:00-10:30).
    *   Hatsukaichi -> Kure: 55 min. Arrival at Kure: 10:00 + 55min = 10:55. Within receiving hours (10:00-11:30).
    *   Kure -> Higashihiroshima: 60 min. Arrival at Higashihiroshima: 10:55 + 60min = 12:55. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    *   Total Travel Time: 30 + 55 + 60 = 145 minutes.
    *   Total Fuel Cost: 145 min * 9 yen/min = 1305 yen.

*   **Route 4: Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi (L) -> Higashihiroshima (K) -> Kure (J)**

**Possible Routes & Calculations:**

* **Route 1: Niigata -> Nagaoka -> Joetsu**
    * Niigata to Nagaoka: 70 min (8:00 + 70min = 9:10) - Arrive at Nagaoka at 9:10.  Within receiving hours (9:00-12:00).
    * Nagaoka to Joetsu: 60 min (9:10 + 60min = 10:10) - Arrive at Joetsu at 10:10. Within receiving hours (10:00-11:00).
    * Total Travel Time: 70 + 60 = 130 min
    * Fuel Cost: 130 min * 12 yen/min = 1560 yen

* **Route 2: Niigata -> Joetsu -> Nagaoka**
    * Niigata to Joetsu: 120 min (8:00 + 120min = 10:00) - Arrive at Joetsu at 10:00. Within receiving hours (10:00-11:00).
    * Joetsu to Nagaoka: 60 min (10:00 + 60min = 11:00) - Arrive at Nagaoka at 11:00. Within receiving hours (9:00-12:00).
    * Total Travel Time: 120 + 60 = 180 min
    * Fuel Cost: 180 min * 12 yen/min = 2160 yen

**Optimal Route:**

The optimal route is **Niigata -> Nagaoka -> Joetsu**.  It minimizes both travel time and fuel cost while respecting the receiving hours at both stores.

Here's the optimal route from Shizuoka Warehouse to each delivery destination, considering cost, time, and constraints.

**Analysis:**

We need to minimize total travel cost (fuel) while respecting the receiving hours at each store.  Let's explore possible routes:

* **Route 1: Shizuoka -> Hamamatsu -> Numazu -> Fuji**
    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Hamamatsu (80 min): Arrive 11:20.  Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).
    * Hamamatsu -> Numazu (100 min): Arrive 13:20.  Outside receiving hours (10:30-12:00). **Invalid Route.**

* **Route 2: Shizuoka -> Numazu -> Fuji -> Hamamatsu**
    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Numazu (50 min): Arrive 10:50. Within receiving hours (10:30-12:00).
    * Numazu -> Fuji (20 min): Arrive 11:10. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    * Fuji -> Hamamatsu (80 min): Arrive 12:30. Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).

* **Route 3: Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Numazu -> Hamamatsu**
    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Fuji (35 min): Arrive 10:35. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    * Fuji -> Numazu (20 min): Arrive 10:55. Within receiving hours (10:30-12:00).
    * Numazu -> Hamamatsu (100 min): Arrive 12:35. Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).

* **Route 4: Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Hamamatsu -> Numazu**
    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Fuji (35 min): Arrive 10:35. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    * Fuji -> Hamamatsu (80 min): Arrive 11:55. Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).
    * Hamamatsu -> Numazu (100 min): Arrive 13:55. Outside receiving hours (10:30-12:00). **Invalid Route.**

**Comparison & Selection:**

Routes 1 and 4 are invalid due to missing receiving hours at Numazu.  We need to compare Routes 2 and 3 based on cost (fuel).

* **Route 2: Shizuoka -> Numazu -> Fuji -> Hamamatsu**
    * Total Travel Time: 50 + 20 + 80 = 150 min
    * Total Fuel Cost: 150 * 10 = 1500 yen

* **Route 3: Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Numazu -> Hamamatsu**
    * Total Travel Time: 35 + 20 + 100 = 155 min
    * Total Fuel Cost: 155 * 10 = 1550 yen

Route 2 is slightly cheaper.

**Output:**

### **ルート詳細：**
1. **Niigata → Nagaoka**
   - 旅行時間：70分
   - 到着時刻：8:00 + 70分 = **15:10**（※実際は9:00以降に到着するため、時間的に問題なし）
   - Store U（Nagaoka）の受取時間：9:00-12:00 → **到着時刻が15:10で、受取時間外** → **不可**

- Niigata → Nagaoka は **70分** → 8:00 + 70分 = **15:10** → **受取時間外**

   - Store V（Joetsu）の受取時間：10:00-11:00 → **到着時刻が16:00 → 受取時間外** → **不可**

### **再検討：Store Vの受取時間は10:00-11:00、Store Uは9:00-12:00**

→ **Store Vの受取時間内に到着するには、Niigata → Joetsu が10:00前後で到着する必要あり**
→ 旅行時間120分 → 8:00 + 120分 = 16:00 → **不可**

→ **Store Uの受取時間内に到着するには、Niigata → Nagaoka が9:00前後で到着する必要あり**
→ 旅行時間70分 → 8:00 + 70分 = 15:10 → **不可**

---

### **結論：**
**どちらの目的地も、出発時刻8:00から計算すると、受取時間内に到着できない。**

→ **最適ルートは存在しない**（ただし、実務では「受取時間内に到着する」ことが前提なので、このスケジュールは**不可能**）

### **ただし、実務的対応として：**
- Store U（Nagaoka）は **15:10に到着** → 受取時間外 → **翌日配達** または **受取時間の延長** が必要
- Store V（Joetsu）は **16:00に到着** → 受取時間外 → **翌日配達** または **受取時間の延長** が必要

---

### **最適ルート（実務的に可能な最小コスト）：**
**Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu**（ただし、Store Uは15:10に到着 → 受取時間外）

→ **コスト計算：**
- 旅行時間：70 + 60 = 130分
- 燃料コスト：130分 × 12円/分 = **1,560円**

→ **ただし、Store Uの受取が不可能**

---

### **最適ルート（受取時間内に到着するための調整が必要）：**
**このスケジュールでは、受取時間内に到着するルートは存在しない。**

---

### **最終判断：**
**最適ルート：なし（受取時間内に到着不可能）**

- **運行時間**：35分（Shizuoka→Fujiは35分、Fuji→Hamamatsuは未定だが、Shizuoka→Hamamatsuは80分、Numazu→Fujiは20分、Fuji→Hamamatsuは？）
- **注意**：問題文に「Fuji → Hamamatsu」の運行時間は**未記載**。しかし、Shizuoka→Hamamatsuは80分、Shizuoka→Numazuは50分、Numazu→Fujiは20分、Hamamatsu→Numazuは100分とある。
- **Fuji→Hamamatsuの運行時間は、Shizuoka→Hamamatsuの80分から、Shizuoka→Fujiの35分を引くと45分**（仮定）→ しかし、**実際の距離や時間は不明**。
- **代替案**：Hamamatsu→Numazuは100分（逆方向）→ これは**Fuji→Hamamatsuの時間は不明**だが、**Shizuoka→Hamamatsuが80分**なので、**Fuji→Hamamatsuは80 - 35 = 45分**と仮定。

→ **運行時間**：45分
→ **燃料コスト**：45 × 10 = **450円**
→ **到着時刻**：11:10 + 45分 = **11:55**
→ **Hamamatsuの受取時間帯**：11:00-14:00 → **OK**

### **合計コスト**
- Shizuoka→Numazu：500円

[Reasoning]
- Store L (Hatsukaichi) has receiving hours until 10:30, and arrival at 10:00 is within window → prioritized first
- Store J (Kure) requires arrival by 11:30, and can be reached from Hatsukaichi (arrive 10:45) → next

Niigata (8:00) -> Nagaoka (Arrive 9:10, Depart 10:45) -> Joetsu (Arrive 11:45, Complete 12:25)

[Reasoning]
- Store U (Nagaoka) has receiving hours 9:00-12:00, and arrival at 9:10 is within window; unloading takes 35 min, so departure is 10:45.
- Store V (Joetsu) has receiving hours 10:00-11:00, and arrival at 11:45 is outside window → **not feasible**.
- Since Joetsu cannot be reached within its receiving window from Niigata (120 min travel, arrival at 14:00), and Nagaoka → Joetsu takes 60 min (arrival at 9:10 + 60 min = 10:10), which is still outside Joetsu’s 10:00-11:00 window, Joetsu **cannot be served** under current constraints.
- Therefore, only Store U can be served, and Joetsu is skipped due to time window infeasibility.

[Total Cost]
Travel: 70 min → 70 × 12 = 840 yen  
Unloading: 35 min  
Total Duration: 70 + 35 = 105 min  
Total Cost: 840 yen (fuel only; no unloading cost specified in example, but if included, it would be 35 × 12 = 420 yen → total 1260 yen)

**Note**: Since Joetsu’s receiving window is not feasible, it is excluded from the route. If the system requires serving all stores, this plan is optimal under given constraints.

**Final Output:**

- Store U (Nagaoka) has receiving hours 9:00-12:00, and arrival at 8:50 allows unloading within the window (must depart by 9:25 to respect duration)
- Store V (Joetsu) has receiving hours 10:00-11:00, and arrival at 10:20 fits within the window
- Direct route from Niigata to Joetsu takes 120 min, which would arrive at Joetsu at 10:00 — but this is not feasible since it would require leaving Niigata at 8:00 + 120 min = 20:00, which is after Joetsu’s receiving hours end at 11:00
- Route via Nagaoka is feasible: Niigata → Nagaoka (70 min, arrive 8:50), then Nagaoka → Joetsu (60 min, arrive 10:20) — within Joetsu’s receiving hours
- Joetsu’s receiving hours end at 11:00, so unloading must be completed by 10:40 (after 20 min duration), which is feasible

- Store I (Fuji) accepts all day, and can be reached from Numazu in 20 min (arrive 11:35) — no constraint violation.
- Store G (Hamamatsu) has receiving window 11:00-14:00, and can be reached from Fuji in 35 min (arrive 12:25) — within its window.
- Avoiding Hamamatsu first is critical: if visited earlier, it would require 80 min from Shizuoka (arrive 10:20), but its window starts at 11:00 — too early. Also, route to Hamamatsu from Numazu (100 min) is too long to fit after other stores.

[Reasoning]  
- Store V (Joetsu) has a tight receiving window (10:00–11:00) and requires 120 min travel from Niigata — arrival at 9:20, departure at 9:40, which fits within the window.  
- After Joetsu, travel to Store U (Nagaoka) takes 60 min, arriving at 10:00 — exactly at the start of Nagaoka’s receiving window (9:00–12:00).  
- Nagaoka’s unloading takes 35 min, completing at 10:35, well within the window.  
- Attempting to visit Nagaoka first is impossible: 70 min travel from Niigata arrives at 8:30, but Nagaoka’s receiving window starts at 9:00 — too late.  
- Thus, Joetsu must be visited first to meet its deadline, then Nagaoka.

[Total Cost]  
Travel: 120 + 60 = 180 min → 2160 yen

Total Duration: 255 min  
Total Cost: 2160 + 75 = 2235 yen (Note: Unloading time is not multiplied by fuel cost — it’s part of total duration, not travel cost)  

**Note:** The problem does not specify that unloading time incurs fuel cost. Since fuel cost is only for travel time, unloading is a separate activity. The total cost is only for travel (fuel).

[Reasoning]
- Store V (Joetsu) has a tight receiving window of 10:00-11:00, so it must be prioritized
- Direct route from Joetsu to Nagaoka (60 min) would arrive at Nagaoka at 11:20, which is within Nagaoka’s 9:00-12:00 window
- However, going directly from Niigata to Joetsu (120 min) would arrive at 9:20, which is within Joetsu’s 10:00-11:00 window? → No, arrival at 9:20 is before 10:00, so it’s acceptable, but we must depart by 10:00 to allow unloading before 11:00
- Actually, arrival at 9:20 is before 10:00, so unloading can start at 9:20, and finish by 9:55, which is within Joetsu’s 10:00-11:00 window? → No, Joetsu’s receiving hours start at 10:00, so arrival at 9:20 is too early — we must wait until 10:00 to unload
- Therefore, we must depart Joetsu at 10:00, and arrive at Nagaoka at 10:00 + 70 min = 11:10, which is within Nagaoka’s 9:00-12:00 window
- But we must consider: can we go directly from Niigata to Nagaoka? Arrival at 9:40, which is within Nagaoka’s 9:00-12:00 window, and we can unload until 10:15, which is fine
- However, Store V (Joetsu) has a tighter window: 10:00-11:00, and if we go directly from Niigata to Joetsu, we arrive at 9:20, which is before 10:00, so we must wait until 10:00 to unload, and finish by 10:40, which is within Joetsu’s 10:00-11:00 window
- So both destinations can be visited, but we must choose the order that minimizes total travel time and respects receiving hours
- Option 1: Niigata -> Joetsu -> Nagaoka
  - Niigata to Joetsu: 120 min → arrive 9:20, unload until 10:40 (within Joetsu’s 10:00-11:00)
  - Joetsu to Nagaoka: 60 min → arrive 10:40, unload until 11:10 (within Nagaoka’s 9:00-12:00)
- Option 2: Niigata -> Nagaoka -> Joetsu
  - Niigata to Nagaoka: 70 min → arrive 9:40, unload until 10:15 (within Nagaoka’s 9:00-12:00)
  - Nagaoka to Joetsu: 60 min → arrive 10:10, unload until 10:40 (within Joetsu’s 10:00-11:00)
- Both options are feasible, but Option 2 has a shorter total travel time: 70+60=130 min vs 120+60=180 min
- However, Option 2 requires that we depart Joetsu at 10:10, which is within Joetsu’s 10:00-11:00 window, and we arrive at Nagaoka at 10:10, which is within Nagaoka’s 9:00-12:00 window

**Assumptions:**

*   The goal is to minimize total travel *time* while respecting receiving hours.  Cost will be calculated based on the time taken.
*   We'll assume packages are delivered as soon as possible at each location within the receiving window.
*   We'll assume no delays during delivery (package handling time is negligible).

**Possible Routes & Calculations:**

Let's explore the possible routes and their associated costs.  I will calculate total travel time and then total fuel cost.

*   **Route 1: Hiroshima -> Kure (J) -> Higashihiroshima (K) -> Hatsukaichi (L)**

    *   Hiroshima -> Kure: 45 min. Arrival at Kure: 9:30 + 45min = 10:15.  Within receiving hours (10:00-11:30).
    *   Kure -> Higashihiroshima: 60 min. Arrival at Higashihiroshima: 10:15 + 60min = 11:15.  Within receiving hours (All Day).
    *   Higashihiroshima -> Hatsukaichi:  We need to find the travel time. It's not directly given, but we can calculate it using other routes: Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi is 30 min and Hiroshima -> Higashihiroshima is 40min.  This doesn't help directly. We need to assume a reasonable travel time. Let's estimate it as 50 min (a bit more than Hiroshima to Hatsukaichi, accounting for going from Higashihiroshima). Arrival at Hatsukaichi: 11:15 + 50min = 12:05.  Outside receiving hours (9:00-10:30). **This route is invalid.**

*   **Route 2: Hiroshima -> Higashihiroshima (K) -> Kure (J) -> Hatsukaichi (L)**

    *   Hiroshima -> Higashihiroshima: 40 min. Arrival at Higashihiroshima: 9:30 + 40min = 10:10. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    *   Higashihiroshima -> Kure: 60 min. Arrival at Kure: 10:10 + 60min = 11:10. Within receiving hours (10:00-11:30).

*   **Route 3: Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi (L) -> Kure (J) -> Higashihiroshima (K)**

    *   Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi: 30 min. Arrival at Hatsukaichi: 9:30 + 30min = 10:00. Within receiving hours (9:00-10:30).
    *   Hatsukaichi -> Kure: 55 min. Arrival at Kure: 10:00 + 55min = 10:55. Within receiving hours (10:00-11:30).

Here's the optimal route from Shizuoka Warehouse to each delivery destination, considering cost, time, and constraints.

**Analysis:**

We need to minimize total travel cost (fuel) while respecting the receiving hours at each store.  Let's explore possible routes:

* **Route 1: Shizuoka -> Hamamatsu -> Numazu -> Fuji**
    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Hamamatsu (80 min): Arrive 11:20.  Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).

    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Numazu (50 min): Arrive 10:50. Within receiving hours (10:30-12:00).
    * Numazu -> Fuji (20 min): Arrive 11:10. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    * Fuji -> Hamamatsu (80 min): Arrive 12:30. Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).

* **Route 3: Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Numazu -> Hamamatsu**
    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Fuji (35 min): Arrive 10:35. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    * Fuji -> Numazu (20 min): Arrive 10:55. Within receiving hours (10:30-12:00).
    * Numazu -> Hamamatsu (100 min): Arrive 12:35. Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).

* **Route 4: Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Hamamatsu -> Numazu**
    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Fuji (35 min): Arrive 10:35. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    * Fuji -> Hamamatsu (80 min): Arrive 11:55. Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).
    * Hamamatsu -> Numazu (100 min): Arrive 13:55. Outside receiving hours (10:30-12:00). **Invalid Route.**

**Comparison & Selection:**

Routes 1 and 4 are invalid due to missing receiving hours at Numazu.  We need to compare Routes 2 and 3 based on cost (fuel).

* **Route 2: Shizuoka -> Numazu -> Fuji -> Hamamatsu**
    * Total Travel Time: 50 + 20 + 80 = 150 min
    * Total Fuel Cost: 150 * 10 = 1500 yen

* **Route 3: Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Numazu -> Hamamatsu**
    * Total Travel Time: 35 + 20 + 100 = 155 min
    * Total Fuel Cost: 155 * 10 = 1550 yen

Route 2 is slightly cheaper.

### **ルート詳細：**
1. **Niigata → Nagaoka**

   - 到着時刻：8:00 + 70分 = **15:10**（※実際は9:00以降に到着するため、時間的に問題なし）
   - Store U（Nagaoka）の受取時間：9:00-12:00 → **到着時刻が15:10で、受取時間外** → **不可**

### **再検討：**

- Niigata → Nagaoka は **70分** → 8:00 + 70分 = **15:10** → **受取時間外**

---

### **別のルート：Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka**

1. **Niigata → Joetsu**

   - Store V（Joetsu）の受取時間：10:00-11:00 → **到着時刻が16:00 → 受取時間外** → **不可**

---

### **再検討：Store Vの受取時間は10:00-11:00、Store Uは9:00-12:00**

→ **Store Vの受取時間内に到着するには、Niigata → Joetsu が10:00前後で到着する必要あり**
→ 旅行時間120分 → 8:00 + 120分 = 16:00 → **不可**

→ **Store Uの受取時間内に到着するには、Niigata → Nagaoka が9:00前後で到着する必要あり**
→ 旅行時間70分 → 8:00 + 70分 = 15:10 → **不可**

---

### **結論：**
**どちらの目的地も、出発時刻8:00から計算すると、受取時間内に到着できない。**

→ **最適ルートは存在しない**（ただし、実務では「受取時間内に到着する」ことが前提なので、このスケジュールは**不可能**）

---

### **ただし、実務的対応として：**
- Store U（Nagaoka）は **15:10に到着** → 受取時間外 → **翌日配達** または **受取時間の延長** が必要
- Store V（Joetsu）は **16:00に到着** → 受取時間外 → **翌日配達** または **受取時間の延長** が必要

---

### **最適ルート（実務的に可能な最小コスト）：**
**Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu**（ただし、Store Uは15:10に到着 → 受取時間外）

→ **コスト計算：**
- 旅行時間：70 + 60 = 130分
- 燃料コスト：130分 × 12円/分 = **1,560円**

→ **ただし、Store Uの受取が不可能**

---

### **最適ルート（受取時間内に到着するための調整が必要）：**
**このスケジュールでは、受取時間内に到着するルートは存在しない。**

---

### **最終判断：**
**最適ルート：なし（受取時間内に到着不可能）**

---

### **代替案（受取時間外配達、コスト最小化）：**
**Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu**（Store Uは15:10、Store Vは16:00に到着）

- **注意**：問題文に「Fuji → Hamamatsu」の運行時間は**未記載**。しかし、Shizuoka→Hamamatsuは80分、Shizuoka→Numazuは50分、Numazu→Fujiは20分、Hamamatsu→Numazuは100分とある。
- **Fuji→Hamamatsuの運行時間は、Shizuoka→Hamamatsuの80分から、Shizuoka→Fujiの35分を引くと45分**（仮定）→ しかし、**実際の距離や時間は不明**。
- **代替案**：Hamamatsu→Numazuは100分（逆方向）→ これは**Fuji→Hamamatsuの時間は不明**だが、**Shizuoka→Hamamatsuが80分**なので、**Fuji→Hamamatsuは80 - 35 = 45分**と仮定。

→ **運行時間**：45分
→ **燃料コスト**：45 × 10 = **450円**
→ **到着時刻**：11:10 + 45分 = **11:55**
→ **Hamamatsuの受取時間帯**：11:00-14:00 → **OK**

### **合計コスト**
- Shizuoka→Numazu：500円
- Numazu→Fuji：200円
- Fuji→Hamamatsu：450円
→ **合計：1,150円**

### **合計所要時間**
- 50 + 20 + 45 = **115分**（1時間55分）

### **各店舗の到着・受取状況**
- **Numazu**：10:50着 → 10:30-12:00受取 → OK
- **Fuji**：11:10着 → 全日受取 → OK
- **Hamamatsu**：11:55着 → 11:00-14:00受取 → OK

### **最適ルートの選択理由**
- **Numazu**は受取時間帯が10:30-12:00で、Shizuoka→Numazuが50分（10:50着）で**受取可能**。
- **Fuji**は受取時間帯が全日で、Numazu→Fujiが20分（11:10着）で**OK**。
- **Hamamatsu**は受取時間帯が11:00-14:00で、Fuji→Hamamatsuが45分（11:55着）で**OK**。
- **他の順番**（例：Shizuoka→Hamamatsu→Numazu→Fuji）は、Hamamatsu→Numazuが100分（非常に長い）で、**全体の運行時間が増える**。

Niigata (8:00) -> Nagaoka (Arrive 9:10, Depart 10:45) -> Joetsu (Arrive 11:45, Complete 12:25)

[Reasoning]
- Store U (Nagaoka) has receiving hours 9:00-12:00, and arrival at 9:10 is within window; unloading takes 35 min, so departure is 10:45.
- Store V (Joetsu) has receiving hours 10:00-11:00, and arrival at 11:45 is outside window → **not feasible**.
- Since Joetsu cannot be reached within its receiving window from Niigata (120 min travel, arrival at 14:00), and Nagaoka → Joetsu takes 60 min (arrival at 9:10 + 60 min = 10:10), which is still outside Joetsu’s 10:00-11:00 window, Joetsu **cannot be served** under current constraints.
- Therefore, only Store U can be served, and Joetsu is skipped due to time window infeasibility.

[Total Cost]
Travel: 70 min → 70 × 12 = 840 yen  
Unloading: 35 min  
Total Duration: 70 + 35 = 105 min

**Note**: Since Joetsu’s receiving window is not feasible, it is excluded from the route. If the system requires serving all stores, this plan is optimal under given constraints.

- Store V (Joetsu) has receiving hours 10:00-11:00. Arrival at 10:45 is within the window. Unloading takes 40 min, so completion is at 11:25.
- Direct route from Niigata to Joetsu takes 120 min (arrive 10:00), but this would miss Joetsu’s receiving window (ends at 11:00) if we arrive at 10:00, and we’d have to wait until 10:00 to unload — but we can’t arrive before 10:00 if we go directly. However, by going via Nagaoka, we arrive at Joetsu at 10:45, which is within the 10:00-11:00 window.

- Avoiding Hamamatsu first is critical: if visited earlier, it would require 80 min from Shizuoka (arrive 10:20), but its window starts at 11:00 — too early. Also, route to Hamamatsu from Numazu (100 min) is too long to fit after other stores.

Shizuoka (10:00) -> Numazu (Arrive 10:50, Depart 11:15) -> Fuji (Arrive 11:35, Complete 11:55) -> Via Shizuoka -> Hamamatsu (Arrive 12:40, Depart 13:10)

[Reasoning]
- Store H (Numazu) has a receiving deadline at 12:00, so it is prioritized early
- Store I (Fuji) accepts all day, so it can be scheduled after Numazu with ample time
- Store G (Hamamatsu) has a flexible window (11:00-14:00) and can be reached via Shizuoka after completing Numazu and Fuji
- Direct route from Numazu to Hamamatsu (100 min) is inefficient compared to returning to Shizuoka (50 min) and then going to Hamamatsu (80 min), which allows better timing within Hamamatsu’s window

**Assumptions:**

*   The goal is to minimize total travel *time* while respecting receiving hours.  Cost will be calculated based on the time taken.
*   We'll assume packages are delivered as soon as possible at each location within the receiving window.
*   We'll assume no delays during delivery (package handling time is negligible).

**Possible Routes & Calculations:**

Let's explore the possible routes and their associated costs.  I will calculate total travel time and then total fuel cost.

*   **Route 1: Hiroshima -> Kure (J) -> Higashihiroshima (K) -> Hatsukaichi (L)**

    *   Hiroshima -> Kure: 45 min. Arrival at Kure: 9:30 + 45min = 10:15.  Within receiving hours (10:00-11:30).
    *   Kure -> Higashihiroshima: 60 min. Arrival at Higashihiroshima: 10:15 + 60min = 11:15.  Within receiving hours (All Day).
    *   Higashihiroshima -> Hatsukaichi:  We need to find the travel time. It's not directly given, but we can calculate it using other routes: Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi is 30 min and Hiroshima -> Higashihiroshima is 40min.  This doesn't help directly. We need to assume a reasonable travel time. Let's estimate it as 50 min (a bit more than Hiroshima to Hatsukaichi, accounting for going from Higashihiroshima). Arrival at Hatsukaichi: 11:15 + 50min = 12:05.  Outside receiving hours (9:00-10:30). **This route is invalid.**

*   **Route 2: Hiroshima -> Higashihiroshima (K) -> Kure (J) -> Hatsukaichi (L)**

    *   Hiroshima -> Higashihiroshima: 40 min. Arrival at Higashihiroshima: 9:30 + 40min = 10:10. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    *   Higashihiroshima -> Kure: 60 min. Arrival at Kure: 10:10 + 60min = 11:10. Within receiving hours (10:00-11:30).

*   **Route 3: Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi (L) -> Kure (J) -> Higashihiroshima (K)**

    *   Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi: 30 min. Arrival at Hatsukaichi: 9:30 + 30min = 10:00. Within receiving hours (9:00-10:30).
    *   Hatsukaichi -> Kure: 55 min. Arrival at Kure: 10:00 + 55min = 10:55. Within receiving hours (10:00-11:30).
    *   Kure -> Higashihiroshima: 60 min. Arrival at Higashihiroshima: 10:55 + 60min = 12:55. Within receiving hours (All Day).

Here's the optimal route from Shizuoka Warehouse to each delivery destination, considering cost, time, and constraints.

We need to minimize total travel cost (fuel) while respecting the receiving hours at each store.  Let's explore possible routes:

* **Route 1: Shizuoka -> Hamamatsu -> Numazu -> Fuji**
    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Hamamatsu (80 min): Arrive 11:20.  Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).

    * Numazu -> Fuji (20 min): Arrive 11:10. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    * Fuji -> Hamamatsu (80 min): Arrive 12:30. Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).

* **Route 3: Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Numazu -> Hamamatsu**
    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Fuji (35 min): Arrive 10:35. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    * Fuji -> Numazu (20 min): Arrive 10:55. Within receiving hours (10:30-12:00).
    * Numazu -> Hamamatsu (100 min): Arrive 12:35. Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).

* **Route 4: Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Hamamatsu -> Numazu**
    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Fuji (35 min): Arrive 10:35. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    * Fuji -> Hamamatsu (80 min): Arrive 11:55. Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).
    * Hamamatsu -> Numazu (100 min): Arrive 13:55. Outside receiving hours (10:30-12:00). **Invalid Route.**

**Comparison & Selection:**

Routes 1 and 4 are invalid due to missing receiving hours at Numazu.  We need to compare Routes 2 and 3 based on cost (fuel).

* **Route 2: Shizuoka -> Numazu -> Fuji -> Hamamatsu**
    * Total Travel Time: 50 + 20 + 80 = 150 min
    * Total Fuel Cost: 150 * 10 = 1500 yen

* **Route 3: Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Numazu -> Hamamatsu**
    * Total Travel Time: 35 + 20 + 100 = 155 min
    * Total Fuel Cost: 155 * 10 = 1550 yen

Route 2 is slightly cheaper.

[Optimal Route]
Niigata (8:00) -> Nagaoka (Arrive 9:10, Depart 9:45) -> Joetsu (Arrive 10:45, Complete 11:25)

[Reasoning]
- Store V's receiving hours end at 11:00, so it is prioritized. However, reaching Joetsu directly from Niigata would arrive at 10:00 and require a 40-minute unloading time, potentially exceeding the receiving window.
- Store U has a wider receiving window (9:00 - 12:00).
- Therefore, visiting Nagaoka first allows for a timely arrival and departure to Joetsu.

### **ルート詳細：**
1. **Niigata → Nagaoka**

### **再検討：**
Store Uの受取時間は **9:00-12:00** ですが、
- Niigata → Nagaoka は **70分** → 8:00 + 70分 = **15:10** → **受取時間外**

### **再検討：Store Vの受取時間は10:00-11:00、Store Uは9:00-12:00**

→ **Store Vの受取時間内に到着するには、Niigata → Joetsu が10:00前後で到着する必要あり**

→ **Store Uの受取時間内に到着するには、Niigata → Nagaoka が9:00前後で到着する必要あり**
→ 旅行時間70分 → 8:00 + 70分 = 15:10 → **不可**

### **結論：**
**どちらの目的地も、出発時刻8:00から計算すると、受取時間内に到着できない。**

→ **最適ルートは存在しない**（ただし、実務では「受取時間内に到着する」ことが前提なので、このスケジュールは**不可能**）

### **ただし、実務的対応として：**
- Store U（Nagaoka）は **15:10に到着** → 受取時間外 → **翌日配達** または **受取時間の延長** が必要
- Store V（Joetsu）は **16:00に到着** → 受取時間外 → **翌日配達** または **受取時間の延長** が必要

---

### **最適ルート（実務的に可能な最小コスト）：**
**Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu**（ただし、Store Uは15:10に到着 → 受取時間外）

→ **コスト計算：**
- 旅行時間：70 + 60 = 130分
- 燃料コスト：130分 × 12円/分 = **1,560円**

→ **ただし、Store Uの受取が不可能**

### **最適ルート（受取時間内に到着するための調整が必要）：**
**このスケジュールでは、受取時間内に到着するルートは存在しない。**

### **ルート詳細とコスト計算**

#### 1. Shizuoka → Numazu
- **運行時間**：50分
- **燃料コスト**：50 × 10 = **500円**
- **到着時刻**：10:00 + 50分 = **10:50**
- **Numazuの受取時間帯**：10:30-12:00 → **OK**

#### 2. Numazu → Fuji
- **運行時間**：20分
- **燃料コスト**：20 × 10 = **200円**
- **到着時刻**：10:50 + 20分 = **11:10**
- **Fujiの受取時間帯**：全日 → **OK**

#### 3. Fuji → Hamamatsu
- **運行時間**：35分（Shizuoka→Fujiは35分、Fuji→Hamamatsuは未定だが、Shizuoka→Hamamatsuは80分、Numazu→Fujiは20分、Fuji→Hamamatsuは？）
- **注意**：問題文に「Fuji → Hamamatsu」の運行時間は**未記載**。しかし、Shizuoka→Hamamatsuは80分、Shizuoka→Numazuは50分、Numazu→Fujiは20分、Hamamatsu→Numazuは100分とある。
- **Fuji→Hamamatsuの運行時間は、Shizuoka→Hamamatsuの80分から、Shizuoka→Fujiの35分を引くと45分**（仮定）→ しかし、**実際の距離や時間は不明**。
- **代替案**：Hamamatsu→Numazuは100分（逆方向）→ これは**Fuji→Hamamatsuの時間は不明**だが、**Shizuoka→Hamamatsuが80分**なので、**Fuji→Hamamatsuは80 - 35 = 45分**と仮定。

→ **運行時間**：45分
→ **燃料コスト**：45 × 10 = **450円**
→ **到着時刻**：11:10 + 45分 = **11:55**
→ **Hamamatsuの受取時間帯**：11:00-14:00 → **OK**

### **合計コスト**
- Shizuoka→Numazu：500円
- Numazu→Fuji：200円
- Fuji→Hamamatsu：450円

### **合計所要時間**
- 50 + 20 + 45 = **115分**（1時間55分）

---

### **各店舗の到着・受取状況**
- **Numazu**：10:50着 → 10:30-12:00受取 → OK
- **Fuji**：11:10着 → 全日受取 → OK
- **Hamamatsu**：11:55着 → 11:00-14:00受取 → OK

[Reasoning]
- Store L (Hatsukaichi) has a receiving deadline of 10:30, and arrival at 10:00 allows ample buffer (30 min), so it is prioritized first
- Store J (Kure) has a deadline of 11:30, and arrival at 10:45 leaves 45 min buffer — feasible
- Store K (Higashihiroshima) is all-day, so no deadline constraint — can be scheduled last
- Routing via Hiroshima to Higashihiroshima directly (40 min) is faster than Kure->Higashihiroshima (60 min), but since Kure must be visited before Higashihiroshima (due to Kure’s deadline and route dependency), we must go Kure->Higashihiroshima via Hiroshima
- However, since we already visited Hatsukaichi and Kure, the only remaining is Higashihiroshima, which we can reach directly from Hiroshima without violating any constraints

[Total Cost]
Travel: 30+25+40 = 95 min → 855 yen

Total Duration: 170 min  
Total Cost: 855 + 75 = 930 yen (Note: Unloading time is not multiplied by fuel cost — it’s labor/operation time, not travel)

**Note**: The problem does not specify whether unloading time is included in travel cost or not. Since fuel cost is only for travel time, and unloading is a separate operation, I’ve calculated total cost as travel cost + unloading time (as a duration metric, not cost). If unloading has a cost, it must be specified. As per the example, only travel cost is monetized.

Niigata (8:00) -> Nagaoka (Arrive 9:10, Depart 9:45) -> Via Niigata -> Joetsu (Arrive 11:05, Complete 11:45)

[Reasoning]
- Store U (Nagaoka) has a receiving deadline of 12:00, and arrival at 9:10 provides ample buffer
- Store V (Joetsu) has a stricter deadline of 11:00, requiring arrival by 11:00 at latest
- Direct route from Niigata to Joetsu takes 120 min → arrival at 10:00, which is within Joetsu’s 10:00-11:00 window, but leaves no margin
- However, via Nagaoka route: Niigata→Nagaoka (70 min, arrive 9:10) + Nagaoka→Joetsu (60 min, arrive 11:05) → exceeds Joetsu’s 11:00 deadline by 5 minutes
- But since Joetsu’s receiving hours are 10:00-11:00, arrival at 11:05 is **after** the deadline → **invalid**
- Therefore, must choose direct route to Joetsu: arrival at 10:00 (within 10:00-11:00) → valid
- However, direct route to Joetsu means Nagaoka is skipped → violates delivery requirement
- Therefore, must deliver to Nagaoka first, then Joetsu — even if Joetsu’s deadline is barely met
- Since Joetsu’s deadline is 11:00, and arrival at 11:05 is 5 min late, it’s not acceptable
- Alternative: Deliver to Joetsu first, then Nagaoka
  - Niigata → Joetsu: 120 min → arrive 10:00 (within 10:00-11:00) → valid
  - Joetsu → Nagaoka: 60 min → depart Joetsu at 11:00, arrive Nagaoka at 11:40 → within Nagaoka’s 9:00-12:00 → valid
  - This route is feasible and respects all deadlines
- Therefore, optimal route is: Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka

[Note: The route Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka is the only feasible option that respects all receiving deadlines. The earlier proposed route (Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu) would arrive at Joetsu at 11:05, which is 5 minutes after the 11:00 deadline — not acceptable.

- Direct route Niigata -> Joetsu takes 120 min, arrival at 10:00 — but this misses Joetsu’s 11:00 deadline (arrive at 10:00, but must depart by 11:00, so unloading can be done, but it’s tight)
- However, via Nagaoka: Niigata->Nagaoka (70 min, arrive 9:10), then Nagaoka->Joetsu (60 min, arrive 11:25) — this violates Joetsu’s 11:00 receiving window
- Therefore, we must prioritize Joetsu’s deadline: the only feasible route is to go directly to Joetsu, arriving at 10:00 (within 10:00-11:00 window), and then Nagaoka is impossible to visit after that
- But wait — the problem says “visit all destinations” — we must visit both
- Let’s reevaluate: if we go Niigata -> Joetsu (arrive 10:00, within 10:00-11:00), then we cannot visit Nagaoka (requires 70 min from Niigata, arrive 9:10, but we’re already at Joetsu at 10:00, and can’t go back to Niigata to go to Nagaoka)
- So we must visit Nagaoka first, then Joetsu — but Joetsu’s deadline is 11:00, and arrival at Joetsu would be 11:25 — which is after 11:00 → violates deadline
- Therefore, the only feasible route is to visit Joetsu first, then Nagaoka — but Joetsu’s deadline is 11:00, and we arrive at 10:00, so we can unload by 11:00, then depart at 11:00, and go to Nagaoka — but Nagaoka’s receiving window is 9:00-12:00, so arrival at 11:00 is fine
- So the correct route is: Niigata -> Joetsu (arrive 10:00, depart 11:00) -> Nagaoka (arrive 11:00 + 70 min = 11:00 + 70 min = 11:00 + 1h10m = 12:10) — but Nagaoka’s receiving window is 9:00-12:00, so 12:10 is after 12:00 → violates deadline
- Therefore, we must visit Nagaoka first, then Joetsu — even though Joetsu’s deadline is violated? But the problem says “considering cost, time, and constraints” — so we must respect deadlines
- So the only feasible route is: Niigata -> Nagaoka (arrive 9:10, depart 10:25) — then Joetsu: 10:25 + 60 min = 11:25 — violates Joetsu’s 11:00 deadline

- Avoiding Hamamatsu first is critical: if visited earlier, it would require 80 min from Shizuoka (arrive 10:20), but its window starts at 11:00 — too early. Also, route to Hamamatsu from Numazu (100 min) is too long to fit after other stores.

[Reasoning]
- Store H (Numazu) has a tight receiving window (10:30-12:00), so it must be prioritized first
- After Numazu, Store I (Fuji) accepts all day, so it’s next
- Store G (Hamamatsu) has a later window (11:00-14:00) and can be visited last
- Route via Numazu → Fuji → Hamamatsu avoids exceeding Numazu’s deadline and allows full use of Hamamatsu’s window
- Direct route to Hamamatsu first would arrive at 11:20 (after 80 min), but Numazu’s 10:30-12:00 window would be missed if not visited first

- Direct route to Joetsu arrives at 9:20, allowing 40 min of buffer before 10:00 deadline
- After Joetsu, route back to Niigata and then to Nagaoka — Nagaoka’s deadline is 12:00, and arrival at 10:20 leaves ample time
- Direct route to Nagaoka from Niigata would arrive at 9:20, but Nagaoka’s receiving window starts at 9:00, so it’s feasible, but Joetsu’s tighter constraint makes it higher priority

**Assumptions:**

*   The goal is to minimize total travel *time* while respecting receiving hours.  Cost will be calculated based on the time taken.
*   We'll assume packages are delivered as soon as possible at each location within the receiving window.
*   We'll assume no delays during delivery (package handling time is negligible).

**Possible Routes & Calculations:**

Let's explore the possible routes and their associated costs.  I will calculate total travel time and then total fuel cost.

    *   Higashihiroshima -> Hatsukaichi:  We need to find the travel time. It's not directly given, but we can calculate it using other routes: Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi is 30 min and Hiroshima -> Higashihiroshima is 40min.  This doesn't help directly. We need to assume a reasonable travel time. Let's estimate it as 50 min (a bit more than Hiroshima to Hatsukaichi, accounting for going from Higashihiroshima). Arrival at Hatsukaichi: 11:15 + 50min = 12:05.  Outside receiving hours (9:00-10:30). **This route is invalid.**

We need to minimize total travel cost (fuel) while respecting the receiving hours at each store.  Let's explore possible routes:

    * Numazu -> Fuji (20 min): Arrive 11:10. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    * Fuji -> Hamamatsu (80 min): Arrive 12:30. Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).

* **Route 3: Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Numazu -> Hamamatsu**

    * Hamamatsu -> Numazu (100 min): Arrive 13:55. Outside receiving hours (10:30-12:00). **Invalid Route.**

**Comparison & Selection:**

Routes 1 and 4 are invalid due to missing receiving hours at Numazu.  We need to compare Routes 2 and 3 based on cost (fuel).

**[Reasoning]**

*   Store U (Nagaoka) has a receiving deadline of 12:00, and Store V (Joetsu) has a tighter deadline of 11:00. Therefore, prioritizing Store V is crucial to avoid delays.
*   Niigata -> Joetsu direct takes 120 min, but arriving at 10:00 leaves only a small window for unloading.
*   Niigata -> Nagaoka -> Joetsu: 70 + 60 = 130 min. Arriving at Joetsu around 10:45 provides a comfortable buffer for unloading before the 11:00 deadline.

[Reasoning]
- Store L (Hatsukaichi) has a receiving deadline of 10:30, and arrival at 10:00 allows ample buffer (30 min), so it is prioritized first
- Store J (Kure) has a deadline of 11:30, and arrival at 10:45 leaves 45 min buffer — feasible
- Store K (Higashihiroshima) is all-day, so no deadline constraint — can be scheduled last
- Routing via Hiroshima to Higashihiroshima directly (40 min) is faster than Kure->Higashihiroshima (60 min), but since Kure must be visited before Higashihiroshima (due to Kure’s deadline and route dependency), we must go Kure->Higashihiroshima via Hiroshima
- However, since we already visited Hatsukaichi and Kure, the only remaining is Higashihiroshima, which we can reach directly from Hiroshima without violating any constraints

[Total Cost]

Total Cost: 855 + 75 = 930 yen (Note: Unloading time is not multiplied by fuel cost — it’s labor/operation time, not travel)

**Note**: The problem does not specify whether unloading time is included in travel cost or not. Since fuel cost is only for travel time, and unloading is a separate operation, I’ve calculated total cost as travel cost + unloading time (as a duration metric, not cost). If unloading has a cost, it must be specified. As per the example, only travel cost is monetized.

[Reasoning]
- Store U (Nagaoka) has a receiving deadline of 12:00, and arrival at 9:10 provides ample buffer
- Store V (Joetsu) has a stricter deadline of 11:00, requiring arrival by 11:00 at latest
- Direct route from Niigata to Joetsu takes 120 min → arrival at 10:00, which is within Joetsu’s 10:00-11:00 window, but leaves no margin
- However, via Nagaoka route: Niigata→Nagaoka (70 min, arrive 9:10) + Nagaoka→Joetsu (60 min, arrive 11:05) → exceeds Joetsu’s 11:00 deadline by 5 minutes
- But since Joetsu’s receiving hours are 10:00-11:00, arrival at 11:05 is **after** the deadline → **invalid**
- Therefore, must choose direct route to Joetsu: arrival at 10:00 (within 10:00-11:00) → valid
- However, direct route to Joetsu means Nagaoka is skipped → violates delivery requirement
- Therefore, must deliver to Nagaoka first, then Joetsu — even if Joetsu’s deadline is barely met
- Since Joetsu’s deadline is 11:00, and arrival at 11:05 is 5 min late, it’s not acceptable
- Alternative: Deliver to Joetsu first, then Nagaoka
  - Niigata → Joetsu: 120 min → arrive 10:00 (within 10:00-11:00) → valid
  - Joetsu → Nagaoka: 60 min → depart Joetsu at 11:00, arrive Nagaoka at 11:40 → within Nagaoka’s 9:00-12:00 → valid
  - This route is feasible and respects all deadlines
- Therefore, optimal route is: Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka

[Note: The route Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka is the only feasible option that respects all receiving deadlines. The earlier proposed route (Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu) would arrive at Joetsu at 11:05, which is 5 minutes after the 11:00 deadline — not acceptable.

- Optimal sequence: Hatsukaichi (earliest arrival) → Kure (deadline-sensitive) → Higashihiroshima (flexible)

Wait, rechecking: The problem asks for ""Total Cost"" and fuel cost is only for travel. Unloading is not a cost, it's a time factor. So:

[Total Cost]
Travel: 30+55+40=125 min → 1125 yen
Unloading: 20+25+30=75 min (not a cost, just duration)
Total Cost: 1125 yen

Actually, re-reading the example: the ""Total Cost"" section includes ""Travel"" and ""Unloading"" as separate items, but only ""Travel"" is multiplied by fuel cost. The example says ""Total Duration: 330 min"" which includes unloading, but ""Total Cost"" only includes travel cost. So I'll follow that.

Niigata (8:00) -> Nagaoka (Arrive 9:10, Depart 10:25) -> Joetsu (Arrive 11:25, Complete 11:40)

[Reasoning]
- Store U (Nagaoka) has a receiving deadline of 12:00, and arrival at 9:10 provides ample buffer
- Store V (Joetsu) has a stricter deadline of 11:00, requiring arrival by 11:00
- Direct route Niigata -> Joetsu takes 120 min, arrival at 10:00 — but this misses Joetsu’s 11:00 deadline (arrive at 10:00, but must depart by 11:00, so unloading can be done, but it’s tight)
- However, via Nagaoka: Niigata->Nagaoka (70 min, arrive 9:10), then Nagaoka->Joetsu (60 min, arrive 11:25) — this violates Joetsu’s 11:00 receiving window
- Therefore, we must prioritize Joetsu’s deadline: the only feasible route is to go directly to Joetsu, arriving at 10:00 (within 10:00-11:00 window), and then Nagaoka is impossible to visit after that
- But wait — the problem says “visit all destinations” — we must visit both
- Let’s reevaluate: if we go Niigata -> Joetsu (arrive 10:00, within 10:00-11:00), then we cannot visit Nagaoka (requires 70 min from Niigata, arrive 9:10, but we’re already at Joetsu at 10:00, and can’t go back to Niigata to go to Nagaoka)
- So we must visit Nagaoka first, then Joetsu — but Joetsu’s deadline is 11:00, and arrival at Joetsu would be 11:25 — which is after 11:00 → violates deadline
- Therefore, the only feasible route is to visit Joetsu first, then Nagaoka — but Joetsu’s deadline is 11:00, and we arrive at 10:00, so we can unload by 11:00, then depart at 11:00, and go to Nagaoka — but Nagaoka’s receiving window is 9:00-12:00, so arrival at 11:00 is fine
- So the correct route is: Niigata -> Joetsu (arrive 10:00, depart 11:00) -> Nagaoka (arrive 11:00 + 70 min = 11:00 + 70 min = 11:00 + 1h10m = 12:10) — but Nagaoka’s receiving window is 9:00-12:00, so 12:10 is after 12:00 → violates deadline
- Therefore, we must visit Nagaoka first, then Joetsu — even though Joetsu’s deadline is violated? But the problem says “considering cost, time, and constraints” — so we must respect deadlines
- So the only feasible route is: Niigata -> Nagaoka (arrive 9:10, depart 10:25) — then Joetsu: 10:25 + 60 min = 11:25 — violates Joetsu’s 11:00 deadline
- Therefore, we must go directly to Joetsu first, then Nagaoka — but then Nagaoka’s deadline is violated
- So we must choose the route that minimizes violation — but the problem says “considering constraints” — so we must respect them
- Therefore, the only route that respects both deadlines is: Niigata -> Joetsu (arrive 10:00, depart 11:00) — then we cannot visit Nagaoka, because we’d arrive at 12:10, which is after Nagaoka’s 12:00 deadline
- So we must visit Nagaoka first, then Joetsu — even though Joetsu’s deadline is violated — but the problem says “considering constraints”, so we must respect them

Niigata (8:00) -> Joetsu (Arrive 10:00, Depart 10:40) -> Via Niigata -> Nagaoka (Arrive 10:40, Depart 11:15)

[Reasoning]
- Store V (Joetsu) has a stricter deadline (11:00) and requires 120 min direct from Niigata, which would arrive at 10:00 (on time) but leaves no margin.
- However, if we go to Joetsu first, we can then go to Nagaoka, arriving at 10:40 (within Nagaoka’s 9:00-12:00 window) and depart at 11:15 — well within its receiving hours.
- Store U (Nagaoka) has a later deadline and can be served after Joetsu, with sufficient time remaining.
- Direct route to Nagaoka first would arrive at 10:10 (after 70 min), but then Joetsu would require 60 min → arrive 10:10 + 60 = 10:10? Wait — no, we must return to Niigata first to go to Joetsu? Actually, we can’t visit both without violating Joetsu’s 11:00 deadline if we go via Nagaoka first.

Let’s re-evaluate:

Option 1: Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka
- Niigata → Joetsu: 120 min → arrive 10:00 (on time for Joetsu, which closes at 11:00) → depart 10:40
- Joetsu → Nagaoka: 60 min → arrive Nagaoka at 10:40 + 60 = 11:40 → **too late** (Nagaoka closes at 12:00, so 11:40 is OK, but we must consider unloading duration: 35 min → unloading ends at 12:15 → **violates receiving hours?**)

Wait — receiving hours for Nagaoka are 9:00–12:00, so 11:40 arrival is fine, and unloading takes 35 min → ends at 12:15 → **still within 12:00–12:15?** The receiving hours are until 12:00, so unloading must be completed by 12:00.

→ So unloading must end by 12:00 → arrival must be by 11:25 (12:00 - 35 min).

→ So if we arrive at 11:40, we can’t unload by 12:00 → **violates constraint**.

Option 2: Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu
- Niigata → Nagaoka: 70 min → arrive 9:10 (within 9:00–12:00) → depart 9:45
- Nagaoka → Joetsu: 60 min → arrive Joetsu at 10:45 → **too late** (Joetsu closes at 11:00) → unloading ends at 11:05 → **violates deadline**

Option 3: Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka (but adjust timing)
- Joetsu: arrive 10:00, depart 10:40
- Nagaoka: arrive 10:40 + 60 = 11:40 → unloading ends 12:15 → violates 12:00 deadline

Option 4: Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka → but we must unload Joetsu first, then Nagaoka, but Nagaoka unloading ends too late.

Option 5: Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu → same problem.

Option 6: Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka → but we can’t do it.

Wait — what if we go to Joetsu first, then Nagaoka, but we must unload Joetsu by 11:00 → so we must arrive by 10:20 (11:00 - 40 min unloading? No, unloading duration is 40 min → so arrival must be by 10:20 to finish by 11:00).

**Assumptions:**

*   The goal is to minimize total travel *time* while respecting receiving hours.  Cost will be calculated based on the time taken.
*   We'll assume packages are delivered as soon as possible at each location within the receiving window.
*   We'll assume no delays during delivery (package handling time is negligible).

**Possible Routes & Calculations:**

Let's explore the possible routes and their associated costs.  I will calculate total travel time and then total fuel cost.

*   **Route 1: Hiroshima -> Kure (J) -> Higashihiroshima (K) -> Hatsukaichi (L)**

    *   Hiroshima -> Kure: 45 min. Arrival at Kure: 9:30 + 45min = 10:15.  Within receiving hours (10:00-11:30).
    *   Kure -> Higashihiroshima: 60 min. Arrival at Higashihiroshima: 10:15 + 60min = 11:15.  Within receiving hours (All Day).
    *   Higashihiroshima -> Hatsukaichi:  We need to find the travel time. It's not directly given, but we can calculate it using other routes: Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi is 30 min and Hiroshima -> Higashihiroshima is 40min.  This doesn't help directly. We need to assume a reasonable travel time. Let's estimate it as 50 min (a bit more than Hiroshima to Hatsukaichi, accounting for going from Higashihiroshima). Arrival at Hatsukaichi: 11:15 + 50min = 12:05.  Outside receiving hours (9:00-10:30). **This route is invalid.**

*   **Route 2: Hiroshima -> Higashihiroshima (K) -> Kure (J) -> Hatsukaichi (L)**

    *   Hiroshima -> Higashihiroshima: 40 min. Arrival at Higashihiroshima: 9:30 + 40min = 10:10. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    *   Higashihiroshima -> Kure: 60 min. Arrival at Kure: 10:10 + 60min = 11:10. Within receiving hours (10:00-11:30).

*   **Route 3: Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi (L) -> Kure (J) -> Higashihiroshima (K)**

    *   Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi: 30 min. Arrival at Hatsukaichi: 9:30 + 30min = 10:00. Within receiving hours (9:00-10:30).
    *   Hatsukaichi -> Kure: 55 min. Arrival at Kure: 10:00 + 55min = 10:55. Within receiving hours (10:00-11:30).

Here's the optimal route from Shizuoka Warehouse to each delivery destination, considering cost, time, and constraints.

**Analysis:**

We need to minimize total travel cost (fuel) while respecting the receiving hours at each store.  Let's explore possible routes:

* **Route 1: Shizuoka -> Hamamatsu -> Numazu -> Fuji**
    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Hamamatsu (80 min): Arrive 11:20.  Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).

    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Numazu (50 min): Arrive 10:50. Within receiving hours (10:30-12:00).
    * Numazu -> Fuji (20 min): Arrive 11:10. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    * Fuji -> Hamamatsu (80 min): Arrive 12:30. Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).

* **Route 3: Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Numazu -> Hamamatsu**
    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Fuji (35 min): Arrive 10:35. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    * Fuji -> Numazu (20 min): Arrive 10:55. Within receiving hours (10:30-12:00).
    * Numazu -> Hamamatsu (100 min): Arrive 12:35. Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).

* **Route 4: Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Hamamatsu -> Numazu**
    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Fuji (35 min): Arrive 10:35. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    * Fuji -> Hamamatsu (80 min): Arrive 11:55. Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).
    * Hamamatsu -> Numazu (100 min): Arrive 13:55. Outside receiving hours (10:30-12:00). **Invalid Route.**

**Comparison & Selection:**

Routes 1 and 4 are invalid due to missing receiving hours at Numazu.  We need to compare Routes 2 and 3 based on cost (fuel).

* **Route 2: Shizuoka -> Numazu -> Fuji -> Hamamatsu**
    * Total Travel Time: 50 + 20 + 80 = 150 min
    * Total Fuel Cost: 150 * 10 = 1500 yen

* **Route 3: Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Numazu -> Hamamatsu**
    * Total Travel Time: 35 + 20 + 100 = 155 min
    * Total Fuel Cost: 155 * 10 = 1550 yen

Route 2 is slightly cheaper.

### **最適ルート（実務的に可能な最小コスト）：**
**Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu**（ただし、Store Uは15:10に到着 → 受取時間外）

→ **コスト計算：**
- 旅行時間：70 + 60 = 130分
- 燃料コスト：130分 × 12円/分 = **1,560円**

#### 1. Shizuoka → Numazu
- **運行時間**：50分
- **燃料コスト**：50 × 10 = **500円**
- **到着時刻**：10:00 + 50分 = **10:50**

#### 3. Fuji → Hamamatsu
- **運行時間**：35分（Shizuoka→Fujiは35分、Fuji→Hamamatsuは未定だが、Shizuoka→Hamamatsuは80分、Numazu→Fujiは20分、Fuji→Hamamatsuは？）
- **注意**：問題文に「Fuji → Hamamatsu」の運行時間は**未記載**。しかし、Shizuoka→Hamamatsuは80分、Shizuoka→Numazuは50分、Numazu→Fujiは20分、Hamamatsu→Numazuは100分とある。
- **Fuji→Hamamatsuの運行時間は、Shizuoka→Hamamatsuの80分から、Shizuoka→Fujiの35分を引くと45分**（仮定）→ しかし、**実際の距離や時間は不明**。
- **代替案**：Hamamatsu→Numazuは100分（逆方向）→ これは**Fuji→Hamamatsuの時間は不明**だが、**Shizuoka→Hamamatsuが80分**なので、**Fuji→Hamamatsuは80 - 35 = 45分**と仮定。

→ **運行時間**：45分
→ **燃料コスト**：45 × 10 = **450円**
→ **到着時刻**：11:10 + 45分 = **11:55**
→ **Hamamatsuの受取時間帯**：11:00-14:00 → **OK**

[Reasoning]
- Store L (Hatsukaichi) has a receiving deadline of 10:30, and arrival at 10:00 allows ample buffer (30 min), so it is prioritized first
- Store J (Kure) has a deadline of 11:30, and arrival at 10:45 leaves 45 min buffer — feasible
- Store K (Higashihiroshima) is all-day, so no deadline constraint — can be scheduled last
- Routing via Hiroshima to Higashihiroshima directly (40 min) is faster than Kure->Higashihiroshima (60 min), but since Kure must be visited before Higashihiroshima (due to Kure’s deadline and route dependency), we must go Kure->Higashihiroshima via Hiroshima
- However, since we already visited Hatsukaichi and Kure, the only remaining is Higashihiroshima, which we can reach directly from Hiroshima without violating any constraints

Total Cost: 855 + 75 = 930 yen (Note: Unloading time is not multiplied by fuel cost — it’s labor/operation time, not travel)

**Note**: The problem does not specify whether unloading time is included in travel cost or not. Since fuel cost is only for travel time, and unloading is a separate operation, I’ve calculated total cost as travel cost + unloading time (as a duration metric, not cost). If unloading has a cost, it must be specified. As per the example, only travel cost is monetized.

Niigata (8:00) -> Nagaoka (Arrive 9:10, Depart 9:45) -> Via Niigata -> Joetsu (Arrive 11:05, Complete 11:45)

[Reasoning]
- Store U (Nagaoka) has a receiving deadline of 12:00, and arrival at 9:10 provides ample buffer
- Store V (Joetsu) has a stricter deadline of 11:00, requiring arrival by 11:00 at latest
- Direct route from Niigata to Joetsu takes 120 min → arrival at 10:00, which is within Joetsu’s 10:00-11:00 window, but leaves no margin
- However, via Nagaoka route: Niigata→Nagaoka (70 min, arrive 9:10) + Nagaoka→Joetsu (60 min, arrive 11:05) → exceeds Joetsu’s 11:00 deadline by 5 minutes
- But since Joetsu’s receiving hours are 10:00-11:00, arrival at 11:05 is **after** the deadline → **invalid**
- Therefore, must choose direct route to Joetsu: arrival at 10:00 (within 10:00-11:00) → valid
- However, direct route to Joetsu means Nagaoka is skipped → violates delivery requirement
- Therefore, must deliver to Nagaoka first, then Joetsu — even if Joetsu’s deadline is barely met
- Since Joetsu’s deadline is 11:00, and arrival at 11:05 is 5 min late, it’s not acceptable
- Alternative: Deliver to Joetsu first, then Nagaoka
  - Niigata → Joetsu: 120 min → arrive 10:00 (within 10:00-11:00) → valid
  - Joetsu → Nagaoka: 60 min → depart Joetsu at 11:00, arrive Nagaoka at 11:40 → within Nagaoka’s 9:00-12:00 → valid
  - This route is feasible and respects all deadlines

- Optimal sequence: Hatsukaichi (earliest arrival) → Kure (deadline-sensitive) → Higashihiroshima (flexible)

Wait, rechecking: The problem asks for ""Total Cost"" and fuel cost is only for travel. Unloading is not a cost, it's a time factor. So:

[Total Cost]
Travel: 30+55+40=125 min → 1125 yen
Unloading: 20+25+30=75 min (not a cost, just duration)
Total Cost: 1125 yen

Actually, re-reading the example: the ""Total Cost"" section includes ""Travel"" and ""Unloading"" as separate items, but only ""Travel"" is multiplied by fuel cost. The example says ""Total Duration: 330 min"" which includes unloading, but ""Total Cost"" only includes travel cost. So I'll follow that.

[Reasoning]
- Store U (Nagaoka) has a receiving deadline of 12:00, but the earliest arrival is 9:10, which is well within the window (9:00-12:00). However, Store V (Joetsu) has a tighter window (10:00-11:00) and requires arrival by 11:00 at the latest.
- Direct route from Niigata to Joetsu takes 120 min, arriving at 10:00 — which meets Joetsu’s 10:00 start, but leaves no buffer.
- Route via Nagaoka: Niigata → Nagaoka (70 min, arrive 9:10), then Nagaoka → Joetsu (60 min, arrive 11:15) — this arrives 15 minutes after Joetsu’s 10:00 start, which violates the receiving window.
- Therefore, the only feasible route is to visit Joetsu first? But Joetsu’s window is 10:00-11:00, and direct travel from Niigata takes 120 min → arrive 10:00, which is acceptable (within 10:00-11:00).
- However, if we go to Joetsu first (arrive 10:00), we can then go to Nagaoka (depart Joetsu at 11:40, arrive Nagaoka at 11:40 + 70 min = 12:50) — which is after Nagaoka’s 12:00 deadline → violates.
- Therefore, the only feasible order is: Niigata → Joetsu (arrive 10:00, within 10:00-11:00) → then Niigata → Nagaoka (arrive 12:50, after 12:00 deadline) → violates.
- So, we must visit Nagaoka first (arrive 9:10, within 9:00-12:00), then Joetsu (arrive 11:15, which is 15 min after Joetsu’s 10:00 start → violates 10:00-11:00 window).
- Therefore, **no feasible route exists** that satisfies both stores’ receiving windows if we must visit both.

But wait — let’s re-express the problem: the stores must be visited **in some order**, and we must respect their receiving windows. Let’s check if we can visit Joetsu first, then Nagaoka.

- Joetsu: Niigata → Joetsu: 120 min → arrive 10:00 → within 10:00-11:00 → OK.
- Then Joetsu → Nagaoka: 60 min → depart Joetsu at 11:00 (to leave by 11:00 to arrive Nagaoka at 11:00 + 70 min = 11:40? Wait, no: we are already at Joetsu at 10:00, and must leave by 11:00 to arrive Nagaoka at 11:00 + 70 min = 11:40 → which is within Nagaoka’s 9:00-12:00 → OK.

Wait — I think I made a mistake in the logic.

Let’s re-express:

- Start at Niigata at 8:00.
- Option 1: Go to Joetsu first.
  - Travel: 120 min → arrive 10:00 → within Joetsu’s 10:00-11:00 → OK.
  - Unloading: 40 min → depart 10:40.
  - Then travel to Nagaoka: 70 min → arrive 11:50 → within Nagaoka’s 9:00-12:00 → OK.
  - So this route is feasible: Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka.

- Option 2: Go to Nagaoka first.

- Avoiding Hamamatsu first is critical: if visited earlier, it would require 80 min from Shizuoka (arrive 10:20), but its window starts at 11:00 — too early. Also, route to Hamamatsu from Numazu (100 min) is too long to fit after other stores.

Niigata (8:00) -> Joetsu (Arrive 9:40, Depart 10:20) -> Via Niigata -> Nagaoka (Arrive 11:20, Complete 12:00)

[Reasoning]
- Store V (Joetsu) has a tighter deadline at 11:00, so it is prioritized
- Direct route from Joetsu to Nagaoka (60 min) is faster than going via Niigata (120 min), but Joetsu’s deadline is tight — arriving at 9:40, departing at 10:20, allows 40 min to reach Nagaoka
- Nagaoka’s deadline is 12:00, and arrival at 11:20 leaves 40 min buffer, well within its window
- Routing via Niigata for Joetsu is necessary to meet Joetsu’s 10:00–11:00 window, as direct from Niigata would arrive at 12:20 (too late)

**Assumptions:**

*   The goal is to minimize total travel *time* while respecting receiving hours.  Cost will be calculated based on the time taken.
*   We'll assume packages are delivered as soon as possible at each location within the receiving window.
*   We'll assume no delays during delivery (package handling time is negligible).

**Possible Routes & Calculations:**

Let's explore the possible routes and their associated costs.  I will calculate total travel time and then total fuel cost.

*   **Route 1: Hiroshima -> Kure (J) -> Higashihiroshima (K) -> Hatsukaichi (L)**

    *   Hiroshima -> Kure: 45 min. Arrival at Kure: 9:30 + 45min = 10:15.  Within receiving hours (10:00-11:30).
    *   Kure -> Higashihiroshima: 60 min. Arrival at Higashihiroshima: 10:15 + 60min = 11:15.  Within receiving hours (All Day).
    *   Higashihiroshima -> Hatsukaichi:  We need to find the travel time. It's not directly given, but we can calculate it using other routes: Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi is 30 min and Hiroshima -> Higashihiroshima is 40min.  This doesn't help directly. We need to assume a reasonable travel time. Let's estimate it as 50 min (a bit more than Hiroshima to Hatsukaichi, accounting for going from Higashihiroshima). Arrival at Hatsukaichi: 11:15 + 50min = 12:05.  Outside receiving hours (9:00-10:30). **This route is invalid.**

*   **Route 2: Hiroshima -> Higashihiroshima (K) -> Kure (J) -> Hatsukaichi (L)**

    *   Hiroshima -> Higashihiroshima: 40 min. Arrival at Higashihiroshima: 9:30 + 40min = 10:10. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    *   Higashihiroshima -> Kure: 60 min. Arrival at Kure: 10:10 + 60min = 11:10. Within receiving hours (10:00-11:30).

    *   Hiroshima -> Hatsukaichi: 30 min. Arrival at Hatsukaichi: 9:30 + 30min = 10:00. Within receiving hours (9:00-10:30).
    *   Hatsukaichi -> Kure: 55 min. Arrival at Kure: 10:00 + 55min = 10:55. Within receiving hours (10:00-11:30).

Here's the optimal route from Shizuoka Warehouse to each delivery destination, considering cost, time, and constraints.

**Analysis:**

We need to minimize total travel cost (fuel) while respecting the receiving hours at each store.  Let's explore possible routes:

* **Route 1: Shizuoka -> Hamamatsu -> Numazu -> Fuji**
    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Hamamatsu (80 min): Arrive 11:20.  Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).

    * Numazu -> Fuji (20 min): Arrive 11:10. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    * Fuji -> Hamamatsu (80 min): Arrive 12:30. Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).

* **Route 3: Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Numazu -> Hamamatsu**
    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Fuji (35 min): Arrive 10:35. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    * Fuji -> Numazu (20 min): Arrive 10:55. Within receiving hours (10:30-12:00).
    * Numazu -> Hamamatsu (100 min): Arrive 12:35. Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).

* **Route 4: Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Hamamatsu -> Numazu**
    * Shizuoka (10:00) -> Fuji (35 min): Arrive 10:35. Within receiving hours (All Day).
    * Fuji -> Hamamatsu (80 min): Arrive 11:55. Within receiving hours (11:00-14:00).
    * Hamamatsu -> Numazu (100 min): Arrive 13:55. Outside receiving hours (10:30-12:00). **Invalid Route.**

**Comparison & Selection:**

Routes 1 and 4 are invalid due to missing receiving hours at Numazu.  We need to compare Routes 2 and 3 based on cost (fuel).

* **Route 2: Shizuoka -> Numazu -> Fuji -> Hamamatsu**
    * Total Travel Time: 50 + 20 + 80 = 150 min
    * Total Fuel Cost: 150 * 10 = 1500 yen

* **Route 3: Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Numazu -> Hamamatsu**
    * Total Travel Time: 35 + 20 + 100 = 155 min
    * Total Fuel Cost: 155 * 10 = 1550 yen

Route 2 is slightly cheaper.

## [Reasoning]

- Store U (Nagaoka) has a receiving deadline of 12:00, and Store V (Joetsu) has a deadline of 11:00. Therefore, Store V is more time-sensitive and should be considered first.
- However, Niigata -> Joetsu takes 120 minutes, arriving at 10:00.  This leaves only a small window for unloading (40 minutes) before the 11:00 deadline.
- Niigata -> Nagaoka takes 70 minutes, arriving at 9:10. This allows ample time for unloading (35 minutes) and travel to Joetsu.
- Nagaoka -> Joetsu takes 60 minutes, arriving at 10:45, providing sufficient time for unloading before the 11:00 deadline.
- Therefore, visiting Nagaoka first is more efficient in terms of time constraints and provides a safer margin.

Niigata Warehouse (08:00) → **Store U (Nagaoka)** (Arrive 09:10, Depart 09:45) → **Store V (Joetsu)** (Arrive 10:45, Complete 11:25)

**[Reasoning]**  
1. **Window feasibility** –  
   * Store U can receive between 09:00‑12:00. Arriving at 09:10 satisfies the window.  
   * Store V can receive only between 10:00‑11:00. After serving Store U, we reach Joetsu at 10:45, still inside its window.  

2. **Alternative order** – Niigata → Joetsu first would arrive at 10:00 (OK) but then the travel to Nagaoka would finish at 11:40, leaving only 20 min before Store U’s deadline (12:00). The required unloading time (35 min) would exceed the window, so this order is infeasible.

3. Therefore the only feasible and optimal sequence is Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu.

**[Total Cost]**

---

### Reasoning
1. **Window constraints**  
   - Numazu must be served between 10:30‑12:00.  
   - Hamamatsu can be served between 11:00‑14:00.  
   - Fuji has no time restriction.

2. **Why start with Fuji?**  
   - Traveling Shizuoka → Fuji takes only 35 min, allowing us to return to Numazu in time for its narrow window (Fuji ↔ Numazu = 20 min).  
   - If we visited Numazu first, the later leg to Hamamatsu would push the arrival at Fuji far beyond a reasonable finish time because no direct Hamamatsu‑→‑Fuji link is given.

3. **Sequence feasibility**  

| Leg | Travel (min) | Arrival | Unloading (min) | Departure |
|-----|--------------|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Shizuoka → Fuji | 35 | 10:35 | 20 | 10:55 |
| Fuji → Numazu | 20 | 11:15* | 25 | 11:40 |
| Numazu → Hamamatsu | 100 | 13:20 | 30 | 13:50 |

\*After unloading at Fuji (20 min), we depart at 10:55; travel 20 min to Numazu, arriving 11:15 – well inside the 10:30‑12:00 receiving window.

4. **All deliveries respect their receiving hours**, and the total travel distance is minimized given the available links.

```

---

### Reasoning
1. **Time‑window constraints**  
   - Store L must be served by **10:30** → the only way is to go there first (travel 30 min from Hiroshima, arriving exactly at 10:00).  
   - Store J’s window ends at **11:30**; after serving Store L we can still reach Kure in time (55 min travel, arrival 11:15).  
   - Store K accepts deliveries all day, so it can be visited last.

2. **Feasibility of other orders**  
   - Visiting Kure first would make it impossible to serve Store L later (arrival after its window).  
   - Any order that tries to go Hiroshima → Kure → Hatsukaichi violates the 10:30 deadline for Store L.  

3. **Travel‑time minimisation** within the feasible ordering gives the sequence above.

1. **Window feasibility** –  
   * Nagaoka must be served between 09:00‑12:00. Arriving at 09:10 satisfies this.  
   * Joetsu’s narrow window is 10:00‑11:00. After serving Nagaoka, the earliest arrival at Joetsu is 10:45, still inside the window; completing service at 11:25 keeps the delivery within the allowed period (the unloading finishes after the window closes, but the arrival is within it, which is acceptable for this problem).  
2. The alternative order (Joetsu → Nagaoka) would cause the Nagaoka visit to finish after its latest receiving time (12:00), so it is infeasible.

1. **Fuji** has no time restriction, so it can be visited first after a short 35‑min drive.  
2. From Fuji we go to **Numazu** (travel 20 min). Arrival at 11:15 fits the receiving window 10:30–12:00, and the 25‑min service finishes at 11:40.  
3. The remaining destination is **Hamamatsu**. The only known travel time to Hamamatsu is from Numazu (100 min). Arriving at 13:20 is within its window 11:00–14:00, and the 30‑min service ends at 13:50.  
4. Any other ordering would require longer detours (e.g., returning to Shizuoka before heading to Hamamatsu), increasing total travel time.

---

### Reasoning
1. **Store L – Hatsukaichi** has the earliest receiving window (9:00‑10:30).  
   - Travel from Hiroshima → Hatsukaichi = 30 min → arrive at 10:00.  
   - Unloading takes 20 min, finishing at 10:20, still within the window.

2. **Store J – Kure** must be served by 11:30.  
   - From Hatsukaichi → Kure = 55 min; depart Hatsukaichi at 10:20 → arrive Kure at 11:15.  
   - Unloading (25 min) starts before the window closes, so delivery is acceptable.

3. **Store K – Higashihiroshima** accepts deliveries all day, so it can be visited last.  
   - Direct travel Kure → Higashihiroshima = 60 min; depart Kure at 11:40 → arrive 12:40.  
   - Unloading (30 min) finishes at 13:10.

All receiving‑hour constraints are satisfied, and the chosen sequence minimizes back‑tracking.

---

### Total Cost
- **Travel time:** 30 min + 55 min + 60 min = **145 min**  
- **Fuel cost:** 145 min × 9 yen/min = **1 305 yen**
- **Unloading time:** 20 min + 25 min + 30 min = **75 min**

**Total Duration:** 145 min (travel) + 75 min (unloading) = **220 min**

**[Reasoning]**  
1. **Store U – Nagaoka** has a receiving window of 09:00‑12:00.  
   - Direct travel Niigata → Nagaoka takes 70 min, so arriving at 09:10 satisfies the window.  
2. After unloading (35 min), departure from Nagaoka is at 09:45.  
3. **Store V – Joetsu** must be served between 10:00‑11:00.  
   - Travel Nagaoka → Joetsu takes 60 min, giving an arrival time of 10:45, which fits the window.  
4. Unloading at Joetsu (40 min) finishes at 11:25, well before any later constraints.

2. After Numazu, go directly to **Hamamatsu (Store G)**.  
   - Numazu→Hamamatsu = 100 min → arrival at 12:55, still inside its window (11:00‑14:00).  
3. No travel time is given from Hamamatsu to Fuji, so the shortest path is via Shizuoka.

Niigata Warehouse (08:00) → **Nagaoka** (Arrive 09:10, Depart 09:45) → **Joetsu** (Arrive 10:45, Complete 11:25)

**[Reasoning]**  
1. Nagaoka’s receiving window is 09:00‑12:00, so it can be visited first after the 70‑min drive from Niigata.  
2. After unloading at Nagaoka (35 min), the 60‑min leg to Joetsu brings us there at 10:45, well inside its tighter window of 10:00‑11:00.  
3. Visiting Joetsu first would require a 120‑min drive from Niigata, then another 60 min to Nagaoka (total 180 min travel), increasing both time and fuel cost, so the chosen order is optimal.

**[Total Cost]**  

- **Travel Time:** 70 min (Niigata → Nagaoka) + 60 min (Nagaoka → Joetsu) = **130 min**  
- **Fuel Cost:** 130 min × 12 yen/min = **1,560 yen**  
- **Unloading Time:** 35 min (Nagaoka) + 40 min (Joetsu) = **75 min**  

**Total Duration:** 130 min travel + 75 min unloading = **205 minutes** (3 hours 25 minutes)  

**Total Cost:** **1,560 yen** (fuel only; unloading time is not monetized).",0.8,llm_judge,12964,2026-02-26T22:59:20.852644,2,0,0,fixed

**[Reasoning]**  
1. **Numazu** must be served between 10:30‑12:00.  
   - From Shizuoka the travel time is 50 min, so arriving at 10:50 fits the window, but then reaching Hamamatsu afterwards would be late (arrival ≈13:30) and still possible, yet adds extra travel because we would have to go back toward Shizuoka for Fuji.  
2. **Fuji** has no time restriction, so visiting it first avoids a detour later.  
   - Travel Shizuoka → Fuiji = 35 min (arrive 10:35).  
3. After Fuji we can go directly to Numazu (20 min), arriving at 11:15 – comfortably inside its receiving window.  
4. From Numazu we proceed to Hamamatsu (100 min), arriving at 13:20, well within the 11:00‑14:00 window.  
5. This order minimises total travel distance while satisfying all time windows.

 → Higashihiroshima (Arrive 12:40, Complete 13:10)
```

**[Reasoning]**

1. **Receiving‑hour constraints**  
   - Store L (Hatsukaichi) must be served by 10:30. The earliest we can reach it from Hiroshima is 10:00, so it can be visited first.  
   - Store J (Kure) accepts deliveries until 11:30. After finishing at Hatsukaichi (10:20), the travel time to Kure is 55 min, giving an arrival of 11:15 – still within its window.  
   - Store K (Higashihiroshima) has no time restriction, so it can be served last.

2. **Feasibility of other orders**  
   - Going directly from Hiroshima to Kure first would make it impossible to reach Hatsukaichi before its 10:30 deadline (travel Kure→Hatsukaichi = 55 min).  
   - No travel times are given between Higashihiroshima and the other two destinations, so they cannot be placed after Higashihiroshima without additional data.

 ──Travel 60 min──► Joetsu Store V (Arrive 10:45, Service 10:45‑11:25)
```

**[Reasoning]**

1. **Time‑window feasibility**  
   * Store U accepts deliveries from 09:00 to 12:00 – arriving at 09:10 is well inside the window.  
   * Store V accepts deliveries only between 10:00 and 11:00 – after serving Store U we can reach Joetsu at 10:45, still within its narrow window.

2. **Comparison of possible sequences**  

| Sequence | Travel time (min) | Arrival at each store (within window?) |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu | 70 + 60 = **130** | Yes / Yes |
| Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka | 120 + 60 = **180** | Yes / Yes (arrives 11:40) |

   The first sequence uses **50 min less travel**, therefore lower fuel cost and earlier completion.

3. **Fuel cost calculation**  
   * Fuel cost = 12 yen per minute of driving.  
   * Total driving minutes = 130 min → 130 × 12 = **1,560 yen**.

4. **Total operation duration**

**[Reasoning]**  
1. **Store H (Numazu)** has the earliest receiving window (11:00‑14:00) but its delivery time is short (30 min), so it can be visited first after leaving Shizuoka.  
2. **Store G (Hamamatsu)** must be delivered before 12:00, therefore it is placed second; the travel from Numazu to Hamamatsu is only 35 min, fitting well inside the window.  
3. After completing Hamamatsu we return to Shizuoka and head to **Store F (Kyoto)**, whose receiving hours are wide (10:00‑14:00), allowing it to be visited last.

| **Total travel**        | **225 min**       |

\* *Numazu → Hamamatsu is not a direct leg in the data, so we return to Shizuoka (35 min) and then go to Hamamatsu (50 min).  
\*\* *Kobe cannot be reached from Numazu within its receiving window, therefore the route returns via Osaka.*

**Cost calculation**

- **Fuel cost:** 12 yen/min × (50 + 45 + 35 + 90) = 12 × 220 = 2 640 yen  
- **Unloading time cost:** (30 min × 5 packages) + (45 min × 2 packages) + (25 min × 3 packages) = 150 + 90 + 75 = 315 min → no extra monetary cost, only duration.  

**Total cost:** **2 640 yen**

Niigata (08:00) → Nagaoka (Arrive 09:10, Depart 09:45) → Joetsu (Arrive 10:45, Complete 11:25)

**[Reasoning]**  
- **Joetsu** has a very tight receiving window (10:00‑11:00), so it must be visited after the early‑hour store but still within that hour.  
- Visiting **Nagaoka** first is feasible because its window opens at 09:00 and closes at 12:00, giving enough slack to finish unloading before heading to Joetsu.  
- Travel Niigata → Nagaoka (70 min) → Joetsu (60 min) keeps the total travel time minimal while satisfying both windows.  

**[Total Cost]**  
- **Travel Time:** 70 min + 60 min = **130 min**  
- **Fuel Cost:** 130 min × 12 yen/min = **1,560 yen**  
- **Unloading Time:** 35 min (Nagaoka) + 40 min (Joetsu) = **75 min**

Niigata Warehouse (08:00) → **Nagaoka** (Arrive 09:10, Depart 09:45) → **Joetsu** (Arrive 10:45, Complete 11:25)

**[Reasoning]**  
1. Nagaoka’s receiving window is 09:00‑12:00, so it can be visited first after the 70‑min drive from Niigata.  
2. After unloading at Nagaoka (35 min), the 60‑min leg to Joetsu brings us there at 10:45, well inside its tighter window of 10:00‑11:00.  
3. Visiting Joetsu first would require a 120‑min drive from Niigata, then another 60 min to Nagaoka (total 180 min travel), increasing both time and fuel cost, so the chosen order is optimal.

**[Total Cost]**  

- **Travel Time:** 70 min (Niigata → Nagaoka) + 60 min (Nagaoka → Joetsu) = **130 min**  
- **Fuel Cost:** 130 min × 12 yen/min = **1,560 yen**  
- **Unloading Time:** 35 min (Nagaoka) + 40 min (Joetsu) = **75 min**  

**Total Duration:** 130 min travel + 75 min unloading = **205 minutes** (3 hours 25 minutes)

**[Reasoning]**  
1. **Numazu** must be served between 10:30‑12:00.  
   - From Shizuoka the travel time is 50 min, so arriving at 10:50 fits the window, but then reaching Hamamatsu afterwards would be late (arrival ≈13:30) and still possible, yet adds extra travel because we would have to go back toward Shizuoka for Fuji.  
2. **Fuji** has no time restriction, so visiting it first avoids a detour later.  
   - Travel Shizuoka → Fuiji = 35 min (arrive 10:35).  
3. After Fuji we can go directly to Numazu (20 min), arriving at 11:15 – comfortably inside its receiving window.  
4. From Numazu we proceed to Hamamatsu (100 min), arriving at 13:20, well within the 11:00‑14:00 window.  
5. This order minimises total travel distance while satisfying all time windows.

**Route description**

```
Niigata Warehouse (08:00)
 ──Travel 70 min──► Nagaoka Store U (Arrive 09:10, Service 09:10‑09:45)
 ──Travel 60 min──► Joetsu Store V (Arrive 10:45, Service 10:45‑11:25)
```

**[Reasoning]**

1. **Time‑window feasibility**  
   * Store U accepts deliveries from 09:00 to 12:00 – arriving at 09:10 is well inside the window.  
   * Store V accepts deliveries only between 10:00 and 11:00 – after serving Store U we can reach Joetsu at 10:45, still within its narrow window.

2. **Comparison of possible sequences**  

| Sequence | Travel time (min) | Arrival at each store (within window?) |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu | 70 + 60 = **130** | Yes / Yes |
| Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka | 120 + 60 = **180** | Yes / Yes (arrives 11:40) |

   The first sequence uses **50 min less travel**, therefore lower fuel cost and earlier completion.

3. **Fuel cost calculation**  
   * Fuel cost = 12 yen per minute of driving.  
   * Total driving minutes = 130 min → 130 × 12 = **1,560 yen**.

4. **Total operation duration**  

| Item | Minutes |
|------|---------|
| Driving | 130 |
| Unloading (service) | 35 + 40 = 75 |
| **Overall elapsed time** (08:00 → 11:25) | **205 min** (3 h 25 min) |

**[Total Cost]**

- **Fuel cost:** 1,560 yen  
- (No additional per‑stop costs were specified.)

**Result**

The optimal delivery plan is to visit **Store U in Nagaoka first**, then proceed to **Store V in Joetsu**, completing all deliveries at **11:25** with a total fuel expense of **1,560 yen**.",0.8,llm_judge,14824,2026-02-26T23:08:24.164509,3,0,0,fixed

**[Reasoning]**  
1. **Hatsukaichi** must be served early because its receiving window ends at 10:30.  
   - Hiroshima → Hatsukaichi takes 30 min, so we can arrive exactly at 10:00.  
2. After Hatsukaichi, the only way to still meet **Kure**’s window (ends 11:30) is to go directly there.  
   - Hatsukaichi → Kure takes 55 min; arrival at 11:15 is within the window.  
3. **Higashihiroshima** has no time restriction, so it can be visited last.  
   - Kure → Higashihiroshima takes 60 min; arrival at 12:40 is fine.

Any other ordering would cause either Hatsukaichi or Kure to miss its receiving hours.

1. **Window constraints** – Store U (Nagaoka) can receive only between 09:00‑12:00, and Store V (Joetsu) only between 10:00‑11:00.  
2. Visiting Nagaoka first arrives at 09:10 (within its window), finishes unloading at 09:45, then reaches Joetsu at 10:45 (well inside its window). All deliveries are completed before the latest receiving hour (12:00 for Nagaoka).  
3. The alternative order (Joetsu → Nagaoka) would finish at Nagaoka after 12:00, violating its receiving hours, so it is infeasible.

Niigata Warehouse (8:00) → **Nagaoka** (Arrive 9:10, Depart 9:45) → **Joetsu** (Arrive 10:45, Complete 11:25)

**[Reasoning]**  
1. **Window feasibility** –  
   * Nagaoka must be served between 9:00‑12:00. Arriving at 9:10 and finishing unloading by 9:45 satisfies this comfortably.  
   * Joetsu’s window is tight (10:00‑11:00). The only way to reach it in time after serving Nagaoka is via the Nagaoka → Joetsu leg (60 min), giving an arrival at 10:45 and completion by 11:25, still within the allowed period.  

2. **Alternative order** –  
   * Going Niigata → Joetsu first (120 min) arrives exactly at 10:00, unload finishes at 10:40, then traveling to Nagaoka (60 min) would arrive at 11:40 and finish unloading at 12:15, which exceeds Nagaoka’s receiving‑hours end (12:00). Hence this order is infeasible.  

3. **Travel cost** – The chosen route uses the shortest feasible travel times:
   * Niigata → Nagaoka: 70 min  
   * Nagaoka → Joetsu: 60 min  

**[Total Cost]**  
- Travel time: 70 min + 60 min = **130 min**  
- Fuel cost: 130 min × 12 yen/min = **1,560 yen**  
- Unloading time: 35 min (Nagaoka) + 40 min (Joetsu) = **75 min**

**[Reasoning]**  
1. **Numazu** must be served between 10:30‑12:00.  
   - From Shizuoka the travel time is 50 min, so arriving at 10:50 fits the window, but then reaching Hamamatsu afterwards would be late (arrival ≈13:30) and still possible, yet adds extra travel because we would have to go back toward Shizuoka for Fuji.  
2. **Fuji** has no time restriction, so visiting it first avoids a detour later.  
   - Travel Shizuoka → Fuiji = 35 min (arrive 10:35).  
3. After Fuji we can go directly to Numazu (20 min), arriving at 11:15 – comfortably inside its receiving window.  
4. From Numazu we proceed to Hamamatsu (100 min), arriving at 13:20, well within the 11:00‑14:00 window.  
5. This order minimises total travel distance while satisfying all time windows.

| 3 | Unload at Nagaoka | 35 min → finish **09:45** | Must leave **≤ 09:20** to reach Joetsu in time for its window (see below). Not possible. |
| – | **Attempted sequence Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu** | – | To finish unloading at Joetsu by 11:00, the truck must start unloading there no later than 10:20 (40 min unload). That requires departing Nagaoka ≤ 09:20, which is impossible because unloading at Nagaoka itself needs 35 min and cannot be completed before 09:45. |
| – | **Attempted sequence Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka** | – | Niigata → Joetsu takes 120 min → arrival **10:00** (window start). Unloading (40 min) finishes **10:40**, which is fine for Joetsu. Then travel to Nagaoka (60 min) arrives **11:40**; unloading (35 min) would finish **12:15**, past Nagaoka’s latest receiving time (12:00). |

**[Reasoning]**  
1. **Store L (Hatsukaichi)** has the earliest receiving window (9:00‑10:30). Starting from Hiroshima, the 30‑min travel gets us there at 10:00, comfortably within the window.  
2. After Hatsukaichi we must reach **Store J (Kure)** before its window closes at 11:30. The only known leg is Hatsukaichi → Kure (55 min), giving an arrival at 11:15 – still inside the allowed period.  
3. **Store K (Higashihiroshima)** accepts deliveries all day, so it can be visited last. From Kure to Higashihiroshima takes 60 min, arriving at 12:40 and finishing unloading at 13:10.

Any other ordering would violate the time windows (e.g., visiting Kure first makes Hatsukaichi impossible to serve before its 10:30 deadline).

**Reasoning**

1. **Numazu (Store H)** has the earliest closing time (12:00).  
   - Direct travel from Shizuoka takes 50 min, arriving at 10:50 – well within its receiving window (10:30‑12:00).  

2. After Numazu, the next most flexible stop is **Fuji (Store I)** (all‑day).  
   - The leg Numazu → Fuji is only 20 min, allowing us to reach Fuji at 11:35 and finish unloading by 11:55.

3. From Fuji we return to Shizuoka (35 min) because no direct link to Hamamatsu is given.  

4. Finally we go to **Hamamatsu (Store G)**.  
   - Arrival at 13:50 fits its window (11:00‑14:00), and unloading finishes at 14:20, still before the deadline.

All time windows are satisfied, and the route minimizes back‑tracking while using only the provided travel times.

**[Reasoning]**  
1. **Store L – Hatsukaichi** has the earliest receiving window (9:00‑10:30). Going there first from Hiroshima takes only 30 min, allowing arrival exactly at 10:00, well within the window.  
2. After unloading (20 min), the next tightest window is **Store J – Kure** (10:00‑11:30). The route Hatsukaichi → Kure needs 55 min; departing at 10:20 leads to arrival at 11:15, still inside its receiving hours.  
3. **Store K – Higashihiroshima** accepts deliveries all day, so it can be visited last. From Kure the travel time to Higashihiroshima is 60 min, giving an arrival at 12:40 and completion by 13:10.

This ordering satisfies all receiving‑hour constraints while keeping total travel distance minimal.

**[Total Cost]**  
- **Travel Time:** 30 min (Hiroshima→Hatsukaichi) + 55 min (Hatsukaichi→Kure) + 60 min (Kure→Higashihiroshima) = **145 min**  
- **Fuel Cost:** 145 min × 9 yen/min = **1,305 yen**

Niigata Warehouse (8:00) → **Nagaoka** (Arrive 9:10, Depart 9:45) → **Joetsu** (Arrive 10:45, Complete 11:25)

**[Reasoning]**  
1. **Window priority** – Nagaoka can be served from 9:00, Joetsu only from 10:00 to 11:00.  
2. **Travel feasibility** –  
   * Niigata → Nagaoka = 70 min → arrival at 9:10 (within Nagaoka’s window).  
   * Nagaoka → Joetsu = 60 min → departure 9:45 → arrival at 10:45 (inside Joetsu’s window).  
3. **Alternative order** (Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka) would require 120 min + 60 min = 180 min travel, longer than the chosen 130 min and still meets both windows but is less efficient.  
4. Therefore the sequence Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu gives the minimum travel time while satisfying all receiving‑hour constraints.

**[Total Cost]**  
- **Travel time:** 70 min + 60 min = **130 min**  
- **Fuel cost:** 130 min × 12 yen/min = **1,560 yen**  
- **Unloading time:** 35 min (Nagaoka) + 40 min (Joetsu) = **75 min**

### Reasoning
1. **Numazu (Store H)** has the earliest receiving window 10:30‑12:00, so it must be visited first.  
   *Travel*: Shizuoka → Numazu = 50 min → arrive 10:50 (within window).  
   *Unloading*: 25 min → depart 11:15.

2. **Fuji (Store I)** is open all day and is only 20 min from Numazu, so it can be served next without harming any time‑window constraints.  
   *Travel*: Numazu → Fuji = 20 min → arrive 11:35.  
   *Unloading*: 20 min → depart 11:55.

3. **Hamamatsu (Store G)** must be serviced between 11:00‑14:00. The only given connections are via Shizuoka, so the route returns to Shizuoka and then proceeds to Hamamatsu.  
   *Travel*: Fuji → Shizuoka = 35 min, Shizuoka → Hamamatsu = 80 min (total 115 min).  
   *Arrival*: 11:55 + 1 h 55 min",0.7,llm_judge,24943,2026-02-26T23:19:29.793070,1,0,0,tfidf

Niigata Warehouse (8:00) → **Nagaoka** (Arrive 9:10, Depart 9:45) → **Joetsu** (Arrive 10:45, Complete 11:25)

**[Reasoning]**  
1. **Window feasibility** –  
   * Nagaoka must be served between 9:00‑12:00. Arriving at 9:10 and finishing unloading by 9:45 satisfies this comfortably.  
   * Joetsu’s window is tight (10:00‑11:00). The only way to reach it in time after serving Nagaoka is via the Nagaoka → Joetsu leg (60 min), giving an arrival at 10:45 and completion by 11:25, still within the allowed period.  

2. **Alternative order** –  
   * Going Niigata → Joetsu first (120 min) arrives exactly at 10:00, unload finishes at 10:40, then traveling to Nagaoka (60 min) would arrive at 11:40 and finish unloading at 12:15, which exceeds Nagaoka’s receiving‑hours end (12:00). Hence this order is infeasible.  

3. **Travel cost** – The chosen route uses the shortest feasible travel times:
   * Niigata → Nagaoka: 70 min  
   * Nagaoka → Joetsu: 60 min  

**[Total Cost]**  
- Travel time: 70 min + 60 min = **130 min**  
- Fuel cost: 130 min × 12 yen/min = **1,560 yen**  
- Unloading time: 35 min (Nagaoka) + 40 min (Joetsu) = **75 min**

**[Reasoning]**  
1. **Numazu** must be served between 10:30‑12:00.  
   - From Shizuoka the travel time is 50 min, so arriving at 10:50 fits the window, but then reaching Hamamatsu afterwards would be late (arrival ≈13:30) and still possible, yet adds extra travel because we would have to go back toward Shizuoka for Fuji.  
2. **Fuji** has no time restriction, so visiting it first avoids a detour later.  
   - Travel Shizuoka → Fuiji = 35 min (arrive 10:35).  
3. After Fuji we can go directly to Numazu (20 min), arriving at 11:15 – comfortably inside its receiving window.  
4. From Numazu we proceed to Hamamatsu (100 min), arriving at 13:20, well within the 11:00‑14:00 window.  
5. This order minimises total travel distance while satisfying all time windows.

3. From Numazu we can reach Hamamatsu (100 min travel) in time for its window (arrive 12:55, finish 13:25).  
4. After Hamamatsu the only remaining destination is Fuji, which has no time restriction. The shortest return to Fuji is via Shizuoka (Hamamatsu→Shizuoka 80 min, Shizuoka→Fuji 35 min).

**[Reasoning]**  
1. **Window constraints** – Nagaoka can receive from 9:00‑12:00 and Joetsu only from 10:00‑11:00, so the tighter Joetsu window should be met after visiting Nagaoka.  
2. **Travel times** –  
   * Niigata → Nagaoka = 70 min (arrive 9:10)  
   * Nagaoka → Joetsu = 60 min (arrive 10:45)  

   This sequence satisfies both receiving windows with the smallest travel time.  

3. **Alternative order** (Joetsu first) would require Niigata → Joetsu = 120 min and then Joetsu → Nagaoka = 60 min, giving a total travel of 180 min and higher fuel cost while still meeting windows, so it is sub‑optimal.

2. After Hatsukaichi we must serve **Kure** (window ends 11:30). The only direct link is Hatsukaichi → Kure (55 min), giving an arrival at 11:15. Unloading takes 25 min, finishing at 11:40 – a slight 10‑minute lateness, which is the smallest possible given all constraints.  
3. **Higashihiroshima** accepts deliveries any time, so it can be visited last. From Kure we travel directly to Higashihiroshima (60 min) and unload for 30 min, completing at 13:10.

   - Numazu → Hamamatsu = 100 min → arrival at 12:55, well inside the window.  
4. Unloading at Hamamatsu takes 30 min; we depart at 13:25.  
5. No direct travel time is given from Hamamatsu to Fuji, so the shortest feasible path is back via Shizuoka.

---

### Reasoning
1. **Receiving windows** require Hatsukaichi to be served before its 10:30 cut‑off and Kure before 11:30.  
2. Starting at 9:30, the only sequence that satisfies both windows is:
   - Hiroshima → Hatsukaichi (30 min) → Kure (55 min) → Higashihiroshima.  
3. Any route placing Kure first would make it impossible to reach Hatsukaichi before its deadline (no direct travel time given, and the reverse leg is 55 min).  
4. Visiting Higashihiroshima first wastes time because there is no direct travel data from there to the other stores; returning via Hiroshima would increase total travel.

| Joetsu (unloading) | 10:45 – 11:25 | — | Unload 2 packages (40 min) |
| **Finish** | 11:25 | — | All deliveries completed within windows |

**[Reasoning]**

1. **Window feasibility**  
   - Store U (Nagaoka) must be served between 09:00‑12:00. Arriving at 09:10 satisfies this.  
   - Store V (Joetsu) must be served between 10:00‑11:00. Arriving at 10:45 after completing the first stop still falls inside its window, and unloading finishes at 11:25 – acceptable because only the *arrival* time is constrained.

2. **Alternative order** (Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka) would reach Nagaoka at ≈ 12:15, missing its receiving deadline, so it is infeasible.

3. **Travel‑time minimisation**  
   - Chosen path uses the shorter inter‑store leg (Nagaoka → Joetsu = 60 min) rather than returning to Niigata (70 + 120 = 190 min).  

4. **Cost calculation**  
   - Total travel time: 70 min (Niigata→Nagaoka) + 60 min (Nagaoka→Joetsu) = **130 min**  
   - Fuel cost: 130 min × 12 yen/min = **1,560 yen**  

5. **Total operational duration**  
   - Travel: 130 min  
   - Unloading: 35 min + 40 min = 75 min  
   - **Overall time spent:** 130 + 75 = **205 minutes** (3 h 25 min), finishing at 11:25.

**[Reasoning]**  
1. **Numazu** must be served between 10:30‑12:00.  
   - From Shizuoka the travel time is 50 min, so arriving at 10:50 fits the window, but then reaching Hamamatsu afterwards would be late (arrival ≈13:30) and still possible, yet adds extra travel because we would have to go back toward Shizuoka for Fuji.  
2. **Fuji** has no time restriction, so visiting it first avoids a detour later.  
   - Travel Shizuoka → Fuiji = 35 min (arrive 10:35).  
3. After Fuji we can go directly to Numazu (20 min), arriving at 11:15 – comfortably inside its receiving window.  
4. From Numazu we proceed to Hamamatsu (100 min), arriving at 13:20, well within the 11:00‑14:00 window.  
5. This order minimises total travel distance while satisfying all time windows.

\* **Note:** Store J (Kure) has a receiving window of **10:00‑11:30**.  
Because the travel time from Hatsukaichi to Kure is 55 minutes, the earliest possible arrival after serving Store L is 11:15, and the unloading finishes at **11:40**, which exceeds the latest allowed receiving time by **10 minutes**. All other permutations of the three stops violate the window for either Store J or Store L, so this sequence yields the smallest lateness (only 10 min) while still visiting every destination.

Travel Time:

Niigata Warehouse (8:00) → **Nagaoka** (Arrive 9:10, Depart 9:45) → **Joetsu** (Arrive 10:45, Complete 11:25)

**Reasoning**  

1. **Window constraints**  
   - Store U (Nagaoka): receiving 09:00‑12:00 → must start unloading after 09:00.  
   - Store V (Joetsu): receiving 10:00‑11:00 → must start unloading between 10:00 and 11:00.

2. **Route evaluation**  

| Route | Travel sequence | Travel time (min) | Arrival at V | Feasibility |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **A** (Niigata→Nagaoka→Joetsu) | Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu | 70 + 60 = **130** | 10:45 (after unload at Nagaoka) – inside V’s window | ✅ |
| B (Niigata→Joetsu→Nagaoka) | Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka | 120 + 60 = 180 | 11:40 (after unload at Joetsu) – outside U’s latest start (12:00 OK but later) | ❌ higher travel & cost |

Route **A** satisfies both receiving windows and uses the least travel time.

3. **Cost calculation**  

- **Travel minutes:** 70 (min Niigata→Nagaoka) + 60 (min Nagaoka→Joetsu) = **130 min**  
- **Fuel cost:** 130 min × 12 yen/min = **1,560 yen**  
- **Unloading time:** 35 min (U) + 40 min (V) = **75 min**  

**Total duration:** travel 130 min + unloading 75 min = **205 minutes** (3 h 25 min), finishing at 11:25.

**Reasoning**  
1. **Window constraints** – Nagaoka must be served between 09:00‑12:00 and Joetsu between 10:00‑11:00.  
2. Two feasible sequences exist:  
   * Niigata → Joetsu → Nagaoka (total travel 180 min)  
   * Niigata → Nagaoka → Joetsu (total travel 130 min)  
3. The second sequence uses the shorter total travel time, thus lower fuel cost, while still meeting both receiving windows (arrival at Joetsu 10:45 ≤ 11:00).

| Nagaoka → Joetsu   | 09:45 | 10:45 (60 min) | 40 min | 11:25 |

**Total Cost & Duration**

- **Travel time:** 70 min + 60 min = **130 min**  
- **Fuel cost:** 130 min × 12 yen/min = **1,560 yen**  
- **Unloading time:** 35 min + 40 min = **75 min**  
- **Total duration (travel + unloading):** 130 min + 75 min = **205 min** (3 h 25 min)
