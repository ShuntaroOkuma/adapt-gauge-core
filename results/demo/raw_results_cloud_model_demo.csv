- Store L (Hatsukaichi) has the earliest deadline (10:30). Departing at 9:30 and traveling 30 minutes allows arrival at 10:00, securing the delivery window. Any other order would result in missing this deadline.
- From Hatsukaichi, traveling to Store J (Kure) takes 55 minutes, arriving at 11:15. This fits perfectly within Store J's receiving window (10:00-11:30).

[Reasoning]
- Store H (Numazu) has a strict receiving window ending at 12:00. Going to Hamamatsu first (80 min travel + 30 min unload + 100 min travel to Numazu) would result in arriving at Numazu at 13:30, missing the deadline.
- Therefore, the eastern route (Fuji/Numazu) must be prioritized.
- To utilize the provided travel link from Numazu to Hamamatsu (100 min), Numazu should be the stop immediately before Hamamatsu.
- Visiting Fuji first (Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Numazu) creates the most efficient path (Travel: 35+20=55 min) compared to backtracking from Numazu to Fuji and back to access the route to Hamamatsu.

[Reasoning]
- Store L (Hatsukaichi) has the tightest morning deadline (10:30). Departing at 9:30 and traveling 30 minutes allows arrival at 10:00, which is safe.

[Reasoning]
- **Constraint Check (Numazu):** Store H (Numazu) has a deadline of 12:00. Visiting Hamamatsu first is impossible (80 min travel + 30 min unload + 100 min travel to Numazu would arrive way past 12:00).
- **Route Efficiency:** Visiting Store I (Fuji) first adds only minimal travel time compared to going direct to Numazu (35+20=55 min vs 50 min), but it positions the truck to travel West to Hamamatsu afterwards without backtracking.
- **Time Windows:**
  - Arriving at Numazu at 11:15 fits safely within the 10:30-12:00 window.
  - The long travel to Hamamatsu (100 min) results in a 13:20 arrival, which fits perfectly into the 11:00-14:00 window.

[Reasoning]
- Store L (Hatsukaichi) has the earliest deadline (10:30). Departing Hiroshima at 9:30 and traveling 30 minutes allows arrival at 10:00, fitting the window perfectly.
- Store J (Kure) has a deadline of 11:30. Traveling from Hatsukaichi takes 55 minutes, resulting in an 11:15 arrival, which is just inside the receiving hours.
- Store K (Higashihiroshima) accepts deliveries all day, so it is scheduled last.

Niigata (8:00) -> Nagaoka (Arrive 9:10, Depart 9:45) -> Joetsu (Arrive 10:45, Complete 11:25)

[Reasoning]
- Store V (Joetsu) has a strict receiving window (10:00-11:00).
- Visiting Nagaoka first allows arrival at Joetsu at 10:45, which fits perfectly within the window.
- This route (Niigata -> Nagaoka -> Joetsu) has a total travel time of 130 min (70+60), whereas going to Joetsu first would result in 180 min (120+60) of travel time. Therefore, this order minimizes cost while satisfying constraints.

[Reasoning]
- Store H (Numazu) has a strict deadline of 12:00. Going to Hamamatsu first (80 min travel + 30 min unload + 100 min return) would make it impossible to reach Numazu in time.
- Therefore, the route must prioritize the eastern area (Fuji/Numazu) before heading west to Hamamatsu.
- Comparing the eastern loop:
  - Route A (Shizuoka -> Numazu -> Fuji -> Hamamatsu): Travel is 50 + 20 + 115 (via Shizuoka) = 185 min.
  - Route B (Shizuoka -> Fuji -> Numazu -> Hamamatsu): Travel is 35 + 20 + 100 (Direct) = 155 min.
- Route B is more efficient and meets all time windows:
  - Numazu arrival at 11:15 fits the 10:30-12:00 window.
  - Hamamatsu arrival at 13:20 fits the 11:00-14:00 window.

[Reasoning]
- Store L (Hatsukaichi) has the earliest deadline (10:30), so it must be visited first.
- From Hatsukaichi to Store J (Kure), the direct route takes 55 min (Arrive 11:15), which fits the 11:30 deadline. Routing via Hiroshima would take 75 min (Arrive 11:35), missing the deadline.
- Store K (Higashihiroshima) accepts delivery all day, so it is the final destination. Direct travel from Kure (60 min) is more efficient than returning via Hiroshima (45+40=85 min).

- Store I (Fuji) is efficiently reached from Numazu (20 min) and accepts deliveries all day.
- Store G (Hamamatsu) is located in the opposite direction. Going to Hamamatsu first would cause a missed deadline for Numazu.

Niigata (8:00) -> Nagaoka (Arrive 9:10, Depart 9:45) -> Joetsu (Arrive 10:45, Complete 11:25)

[Reasoning]
- Store V (Joetsu) has a narrow receiving window that ends at 11:00. However, it can still be reached by 10:45 even after completing the delivery at Store U (Nagaoka).
- Visiting Nagaoka first is significantly more efficient, resulting in a total travel time of 130 minutes. In contrast, visiting Joetsu first would require 180 minutes of travel time and would cause the delivery at Nagaoka to finish after its 12:00 deadline (at 12:15).
- All arrival times in the chosen route fall within the specified receiving hours.

[Reasoning]
- Store L (Hatsukaichi) has the tightest morning deadline (10:30), so it must be visited first.
- Store J (Kure) has a deadline of 11:30. By traveling directly from Hatsukaichi to Kure (55 min), the arrival time is 11:15, which satisfies the constraint.
- Store K (Higashihiroshima) has no specific time constraints (""All Day""), so it is scheduled last to accommodate the other stores' windows.

- Store H (Numazu) has a receiving deadline of 12:00, so the eastern route is prioritized.
- Store I (Fuji) is visited first as it is on the direct path to Numazu, allowing for an efficient sequence that reaches Numazu by 11:15.

- Routing via Shizuoka provides the necessary margin for the final delivery to Hamamatsu.

3つの目的地を全て訪問するルートの順列は3! = 6通りありますが、与えられた移動時間情報のみでは、全ての区間の移動時間が網羅されていません。
例えば、「東広島 -> 呉」や「呉 -> 廿日市」、「東広島 <-> 廿日市」などの移動時間が不足しています。
そのため、与えられた情報のみで計算可能なルートは限られます。

以下に、与えられた移動時間情報のみで計算可能な唯一のルートを評価します。

**評価ルート: 広島倉庫 -> Store L (廿日市) -> Store J (呉) -> Store K (東広島)**

1.  **広島倉庫 (9:30出発) -> Store L (廿日市)**
    *   移動時間: 30分
    *   到着時刻: 9:30 + 30分 = 10:00
    *   Store Lの受付時間: 9:00-10:30
    *   到着時刻 10:00 は受付時間内です。待機時間はありません。
    *   配送開始: 10:00
    *   配送時間: 20分
    *   配送完了: 10:00 + 20分 = 10:20
    *   この区間の移動コスト: 30分 × 9円/分 = 270円

2.  **Store L (10:20出発) -> Store J (呉)**
    *   移動時間: 55分
    *   到着時刻: 10:20 + 55分 = 11:15
    *   Store Jの受付時間: 10:00-11:30
    *   到着時刻 11:15 は受付時間内です。待機時間はありません。
    *   配送開始: 11:15
    *   配送時間: 25分
    *   配送完了: 11:15 + 25分 = 11:40
    *   この区間の移動コスト: 55分 × 9円/分 = 495円

3.  **Store J (11:40出発) -> Store K (東広島)**
    *   移動時間: 60分
    *   到着時刻: 11:40 + 60分 = 12:40
    *   Store Kの受付時間: 終日
    *   到着時刻 12:40 は受付時間内です。待機時間はありません。
    *   配送開始: 12:40
    *   配送時間: 30分
    *   配送完了: 12:40 + 30分 = 13:10
    *   この区間の移動コスト: 60分 × 9円/分 = 540円

[Reasoning]
- Store V (Joetsu) has a tight receiving window of 10:00-11:00.
- Route Niigata -> Nagaoka -> Joetsu allows arrival at Nagaoka at 9:10 (within 9:00-12:00 window) and departure at 9:45. This leads to an arrival at Joetsu at 10:45, which is within its 10:00-11:00 receiving window.
- The alternative route, Niigata -> Joetsu -> Nagaoka, would result in a later arrival at Nagaoka (11:40), but more importantly, it incurs a higher total travel time and thus higher fuel cost.
- This chosen route minimizes total travel time while satisfying all receiving hour constraints.

[Reasoning]
- Store H (Numazu) has the tightest receiving hours (10:30-12:00), so it is prioritized. Arriving at 10:50 allows for delivery within this window.
- From Numazu, Store I (Fuji) is the next most efficient destination (Numazu -> Fuji: 20 min). Arriving at Fuji at 11:35 is well within its ""All Day"" receiving hours.
- After Fuji, to reach Store G (Hamamatsu), returning to Shizuoka is necessary as there is no direct route from Fuji to Hamamatsu in the provided travel times. (We assume Fuji -> Shizuoka travel time is 35 min, same as Shizuoka -> Fuji).
- From Shizuoka, the driver proceeds to Hamamatsu. Arriving at Hamamatsu at 13:50 is within its receiving hours (11:00-14:00).
- This route ensures all time window constraints are met with the minimum total travel time.

[Reasoning]
- Store L (Hatsukaichi) has the earliest receiving hours deadline (10:30), so it is prioritized.
- After visiting Store L, it becomes impossible to complete delivery to Store J (Kure) within its receiving hours (10:00-11:30) due to travel time and unloading duration. However, this route minimizes the time overrun for Store J while prioritizing the earliest deadline.
- Store K (Higashihiroshima) accepts deliveries all day, so it is visited last.

[Reasoning]
- Store H (Numazu) has the most restrictive receiving hours (10:30-12:00), making it a critical point in the route planning.
- Visiting Fuji (Store I) first is efficient as it has ""All Day"" receiving hours and is relatively close to Shizuoka (35 min).

3. **Why Not Reverse Order?**
   - If Joetsu first: Depart 8:00 + 120 min = Arrive 10:00 (cutting it close)
   - Then Nagaoka: 10:00 + 40 min unload + 60 min travel = 11:40 (exceeds Nagaoka's 12:00 limit by risk)

   - Departure: 10:50 + 25 min = 11:15

2. **Store I (Fuji) Second**: Accepts all day, but positioned between Numazu and Hamamatsu to optimize route efficiency.
   - Arrival: 11:15 + 20 min = 11:35 ✓
   - Departure: 11:35 + 20 min = 11:55

3. **Store G (Hamamatsu) Last**: Latest receiving hours (11:00-14:00) allow flexibility.
   - Arrival: 11:55 + (via Fuji-Hamamatsu route) = 12:15 ✓ (Within 11:00-14:00)

## [Reasoning]

- Store V (Joetsu) has a tight receiving window ending at 11:00, making it the critical constraint
- Store U (Nagaoka) has a more flexible window (9:00-12:00)
- Direct route Niigata -> Nagaoka -> Joetsu ensures arrival at Joetsu by 10:45, within the 10:00-11:00 window

## 制約条件の分析

- **出発**: 9:30（広島倉庫）
- **Store L**: 10:30までに到着・作業完了必要 → **最優先**
- **Store J**: 10:00-11:30の間に到着必要
- **Store K**: 時間制約なし

## 実行可能ルートの検討

### ルート1: 広島 → L(廿日市) → J(呉) → K(東広島)

| L→J | 10:20 | 55分 | 11:15 | 25分 | 11:40 | ✅ (11:30までに到着) |
| J→K | 11:40 | 60分 | 12:40 | 30分 | 13:10 | ✅ (終日OK) |

**総移動時間**: 30 + 55 + 60 = **145分**
**燃料コスト**: 145 × 9 = **1,305円**

### ルート2: 広島 → L(廿日市) → K(東広島) → J(呉)

※ 廿日市→東広島の直接ルートがないため、広島経由と仮定（30+40=70分）

- Store V's receiving hours are very limited (10:00-11:00), requiring careful timing
- Route analysis:
  - **Route 1: Niigata -> Nagaoka -> Joetsu**
    - Nagaoka: Arrive 9:10 (within 9:00-12:00 ✓), Depart 9:45
    - Joetsu: Arrive 10:45 (within 10:00-11:00 ✓), must START unloading before 11:00 ✓

  - Depart 8:00, arrive 10:00 (exactly at opening), unload 40 min, depart 10:40 ✓
- Store U (Nagaoka) has receiving hours 9:00-12:00
  - Joetsu -> Nagaoka: 60 min, arrive 11:40, unload 35 min, complete 12:15
  - Arrival at 11:40 is within receiving hours ✓

[Reasoning]
- Store L (Hatsukaichi) has the earliest deadline at 10:30, so it is the top priority
- Store J (Kure) has a receiving deadline of 11:30; direct route from Hatsukaichi (55 min) would arrive at 11:15, but routing via Hiroshima (30+45=75 min) arrives at 11:05 - both are within the deadline, but direct is faster
- However, checking direct route: Hatsukaichi (10:20) -> Kure direct (55 min) = Arrive 11:15, which is within 11:30 deadline
- Store K (Higashihiroshima) accepts all day, so it is last

- Store V (Joetsu) has a very tight receiving window of only 10:00-11:00
- Going directly to Joetsu from Niigata (120 min) would arrive at 10:00, but unloading takes 40 min, ending at 10:40 ✓
- However, routing via Nagaoka first: Niigata -> Nagaoka (70 min) -> Joetsu (60 min) = 130 min total travel

- Direct to Joetsu first: Arrive 10:00, depart 10:40, then to Nagaoka via reverse would take too long

**Revised Optimal Route:**

[Revised Reasoning]
- Store V (Joetsu) has the strictest window (10:00-11:00), must arrive by 10:20 to complete unloading
- Direct route arrives exactly at 10:00, unloading completes at 10:40 ✓
- Store U (Nagaoka) deadline is 12:00; arriving at 11:40 means unloading ends at 12:15 ✗
